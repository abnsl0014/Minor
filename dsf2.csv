In 1905, he published three path- breaking papers. In the first paper, he introduced the notion of light quanta (now called photons) and used it to explain the features of photoelectric effect. In the second paper, he developed a theory of Brownian motion, confirmed experimentally a few years later and provided a convincing evidence of the atomic picture of matter. The third paper gave birth to the special theory of relativity. In 1916, he published the general theory of relativity. Some of Einstein’s most significant later contributions are: the notion of stimulated emission introduced in an alternative derivation of Planck’s blackbody radiation law, static model of the universe which started modern cosmology, quantum statistics of a gas of massive bosons, and a critical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his contribution to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect. has energy hv, where h is Planck’s constant and v the frequency of light. In photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy (hv) of radiation. If this quantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum energy needed for the electron to escape from the metal surface (work function $0), the electron is emitted with maximum kinetic energy Kmax=hv—¢O (11.2) More tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic energies less than the maximum value. Note that the intensity of light of a given frequency is determined by the number of photons incident per second. Increasing the intensitywill increase the number of emitted electrons per second. However, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each photon. Equation (1 1.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric equation. We now see how this equation accounts in a simple and elegant manner all the observations on photoelectric effect given at the end of sub-section 1 1.4.3. 0 According to Eq. (1 1.2), Kmax depends linearly on v, and is independent of intensity of radiation, in agreement with observation. This has happened because in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises from the absorption of a single quantum of radiation by a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process. 0 Since Kmax must be non-negative, Eq. (1 1.2 ) implies that photoelectric emission is possible only if h v > ()0 or v > v0 , where _ h ‘ h Equation (11.3) shows that the greater the work function ()0, the higher the minimum or threshold frequency v0 needed to emit photoelectrons. Thus, there exists a threshold frequency v0 (= 9150/ h) for the metal surface, below which no photoelectric emission is possible, no matter how intense the incident radiation may be or how long it falls on the surface. 0 In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above, is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time. The greater the number of energy quanta available, the greater is the number of electrons absorbing the energy quanta and greater, therefore, is the number of electrons coming out of the metal (for v > v0). This explains why, for v > v0, photoelectric current is proportional to intensity. vO (11.3) 2019-20",0

This change is due to competition where the secondary forest species such as grasses, bamboos or pines overtakes the native species changing the original forest structure. This is called succession. Ecological balance may be disturbed due to the introduction of new species, natural hazards or human causes. Human interference has affected the balance of plant communities leading to disturbances in the ecosystems. Such disturbances bring about numerous secondary successions. Human pressure on the earth’s resources has put a heavy toll on 129 the ecosystem. This has destroyed its originality and has caused adverse effects to the general environment. Ecological imbalances have brought many natural calamities like ﬂoods, landslides, diseases, erratic climatic occurrences, etc. There is a very close relationship between the plant and animal communities within particular habitats.

8,937,"SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS Pollination by wind is more common amongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination also requires that the pollen grains are light and non-sticky so that they can be transported in wind currents. They often possess well-exposed stamens (so that the pollens are easily dispersed into wind currents, Figure 2.10) and large often-feathery stigma to easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind- pollinated ﬂowers often have a single ovule in each ovary and numerous ﬂowers packed into an inﬂorescence; a familiar example is the corn cob — the tassels you see are nothing but the stigma and style which wave in the wind to trap pollen grains. Wind-pollination is quite common in grasses. Pollination by water is quite rare in ﬂowering plants and is limited to about 30 genera, mostly monocotyledons. As against this, you would recall that water is a regular mode of transport for the male gametes among the lower plant groups such as algae, bryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed, particularly for some bryophytes and Figure 2- 10 A wind-pollinated plant 3110‘”ng pteridophytes, that their distribution is limited compaCt inﬂorecence and well— exposed stamens because of the need for water for the transport of male gametes and fertilisation. Some examples of water pollinated plants are Vallisneria and Hydrilla which grow in fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as Zostera. Not all aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants such as water hyacinth and water lily, the ﬂowers emerge above the level of water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land plants. In Vallisneria, the female ﬂower reach the surface of water by the long stalk and the male ﬂowers or pollen grains are released on to the surface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure 2.1 1a); some of them eventually reach the female ﬂowers and the stigma. In another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female ﬂowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released inside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like and they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the stigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species, pollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering. Both wind and water pollinated ﬂowers are not very colourful and do not produce nectar.

13,647,"LAWS OF MOTION 97 always occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces between two bodies are always equal and opposite. This idea was expressed by Newton in the form of the third law of motion. To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction. Newton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and beautiful that it has become a part of common language. For the same reason perhaps, misconceptions about the third law abound. Let us note some important points about the third law, particularly in regard to the usage of the terms : action and reaction. 1. The terms action and reaction in the third law mean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different terms for the same physical concept can sometimes be confusing. A simple and clear way of stating the third law is as follows: Forces always occur in pairs. Force on a body A by B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A. 2. The terms action and reaction in the third law may give a wrong impression that action reﬂecting telescope. Isaac Newton (1 642 - 1 72 7) Isaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe, England in 1642. the year Galileo died. His extraordinary mathematical ability and mechanical aptitude remained hidden from others in his school life. In 1662. he went to Cambridge for undergraduate studies. A plague epidemic in 1665 forced the university town to close and Newton had to return to his mother's farm. There in two years of solitude, his dormant creativity blossomed in a deluge of fundamental discoveries in mathematics and physics : binomial theorem for negative and fractional exponents. the beginning of calculus. the inverse square law of gravitation. the spectrum of white light. and so on. Returning to Cambridge. he pursued his investigations in optics and devised a In 1684. encouraged by his friend Edmund Halley. Newton embarked on writing what was to be one of the greatest scientiﬁc works ever published : The Principia Mathematica. In it. he enunciated the three laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation. which explained all the three Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The book was packed with a host of path—breaking achievements : basic principles of ﬂuid mechanics. mathematics of wave motion, calculation of masses of the earth. the sun and other planets, explanation of the precession of equinoxes. theory of tides, etc. In 1704, Newton brought out another masterpiece Opticks that summarized his work on light and colour. The scientific revolution triggered by Copernicus and steered vigorously ahead by Kepler and Galileo was brought to a grand completion by Newton. Newtonian mechanics uniﬁed terrestrial and celestial phenomena. The same mathematical equation governed the fall of an apple to the ground and the motion of the moon around the earth. The age of reason had dawned. comes before reaction i.e action is the cause and reaction the effect. There is no cause- effect relation implied in the third law. The force on A by B and the force on B by A act at the same instant. By the same reasoning, any one of them may be called action and the other reaction. 3. Action and reaction forces act on different bodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. According to the third law, F = — FBA (5.8) AB (force on A by B) = — (force on B by A) Thus if we are considering the motion of any one body (A or B), only one of the two forces is relevant. It is an error to add up the two forces and claim that the net force is zero. However, if you are considering the system of two bodies as a whole, F AB and FBA are internal forces of the system (A + B). They add up to give a null force. Internal forces in a body or a system of particles thus cancel away in pairs. This is an important fact that enables the second law to be applicable to a body or a system of particles (See Chapter 7). 2019-20",0

The adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called zona reticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zona glomerulosa (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones, commonly called as corticoids. The corticoids, which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol is the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid in our body. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis; and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also involved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney functions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces anti- inﬂammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol stimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na“ and water and excretion of K’“ and phosphate ions. ’Ihus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of electrolytes, body ﬂuid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure. Small amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal cortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial hair during puberty. 22.2.8 Pancreas Pancreas is a composite gland (Figure 22.1) which acts as both exocrine and endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‘Islets of Langerhans’. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a normal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatic tissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are called a—cells and B—cells. The oc—cells secrete a hormone called glucagon, while the B—cells secrete insulin. Glucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role in maintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly on the liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia). In addition, this hormone stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to hyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and utilisation. Thus, glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone. Insulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytes and adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose 337",1

Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids, glycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic compounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5 types of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esteriﬁed to glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous compound. Only three types of macromolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and polysaccharides are found in living systems. Lipids, because of their association with membranes separate in the macromolecular fraction. Biomacromolecules are polymers. They are made of building blocks which are different. Proteins are heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are composed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures — primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Nucleic acids serve as genetic material. Polysaccharides are components of cell wall in plants, fungi and also of the exoskeleton of arthropods. They also are storage forms of energy (e. g., starch and glycogen).

(A particle is ideally represented as a point mass having no size.) We applied the results of our study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the motion of a particle. Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies (bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here. We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding the motion of extended bodies. A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape. The distances between all pairs of particles of such a body do not change. It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the inﬂuence of forces. But in many situations the deformations are negligible. In a number of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat them as rigid. 7.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have? Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples of the motion of rigid bodies. Let us begin with a rectangular 2019-20",0

The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile and auditory inputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla. The cerebellum integrates information received from the semicircular canals of the ear and the auditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control respiration, cardiovascular reﬂexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of ﬁbre tracts that interconnect different regions of the brain. The entire process of involuntary response to a peripheral nervous stimulation is called reﬂex action. Information regarding changes in the environment is received by the CNS through the sensory organs which are processed and analysed. Signals are then sent for necessary adjustments. The wall of the human eye ball is composed of three layers. The external layer is composed of cornea and sclera. Inside sclera is the middle layer, which is called the choroid.

19,1022,"ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES Hospitals generate hazardous wastes that contain disinfectants and other harmful chemicals, and also pathogenic micro-organisms. Such wastes also require careful treatment and disposal. The use of incinerators is crucial to disposal of hospital waste. Irreparable computers and other electronic goods are known as electronic wastes (e-wastes). E-wastes are burried in landﬁlls or incinerated. Over half of the e-wastes generated in the developed world are exported to developing countries, mainly to China, India and Pakistan, where metals like copper, iron, silicon, nickel and gold are recovered during recycling process. Unlike developed countries, which have speciﬁcally built facilities for recycling of e-wastes, recycling in developing countries often involves manual participation thus exposing workers to toxic substances present in e-wastes. Recycling is the only solution for the treatment of e-waste, provided it is carried out in an environment- friendly manner. 16.3. 1 Case Study of Remedy for Plastic Waste A plastic sack manufacturer in Bangalore has managed to ﬁnd the ideal solution to the ever-increasing problem of accumulating plastic waste. Ahmed Khan, aged 57 years old, has been producing plastic sacks for 20 years. About 8 years ago, he realised that plastic waste was a real problem. Polyblend, a ﬁne powder of recycled modiﬁed plastic, was developed then by his company. This mixture is mixed with the bitumen that is used to lay roads. In collaboration with R.V. College of Engineering and the Bangalore City Corporation, Ahmed Khan proved that blends of Polyblend and bitumen, when used to lay roads, enhanced the bitumen’s water repellant properties, and helped to increase road life by a factor of three. The raw material for creating Polyblend is any plastic ﬁlm waste. So, against the price of Rs. 0.40 per kg that rag pickers had been getting for plastic waste, Khan now offers Rs.6. Using Khan’s technique, by the year 2002, more than 40 kms of road in Bangalore has already been laid. At this rate, Khan will soon be running short of plastic waste in Bangalore, to produce Polyblend. Thanks to innovations like Polyblend, we might still avoid being smothered by plastic waste. 16.4 AGRO-CHEMICALS AND THEIR EFFECTS In the wake of green revolution, use of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides has increased manifold for enhancing crop production. Pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc., are being increasingly used. These incidentally, are also toxic to non-target organisms,that are important components of the soil ecosystem. Do you think these can be biomagniﬁed in the terrestrial ecosystems? We know what the addition of increasing amounts of chemical fertilisers can do to aquatic ecosystems vis-a-vis eutrophication. The current problems in agriculture are, therefore, extremely grave. 2019—2020 279",1

Electrostatic ﬁeld lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a negative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops. 2. The discussion in this Chapter holds only for steady currents which do not vary with time. When currents vary with time Newton’s third law is valid only if momentum carried by the electromagnetic ﬁeld is taken into account. 3. Recall the expression for the Lorentz force. F=q(v><B+E) This velocity dependent force has occupied the attention of some of the greatest scientiﬁc thinkers. If one switches to a frame with instantaneous velocity v. the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of the charged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists an appropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss the details of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of this paradox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena (electromagnetism) and that the Lorentz force expression does not imply a universal preferred frame of reference in nature. 4. Ampere’s Circuital law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. It can be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to the Biot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss’s law and 1 68 Coulomb’s law. 2019-20",0

22,587,"372 PHYSICS 15.3.2 Wavelength and Angular Wave Number The minimum distance between two points having the same phase is called the wavelength of the wave, usually denoted by 7L. For simplicity, we can choose points of the same phase to be crests or troughs. The wavelength is then the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs in a wave. Taking q) = O in Eq. (15.2), the displacement at t= O is given by y(x,0)= asinkx (15.5) Since the sine function repeats its value after every 27: change in angle, sinkx = sin(kx + 2n7r) = sink (x + %) That is the displacements at points x and at 2n7r x+— k are the same, where n=1,2,3,... The least distance between points with the same displacement (at any given instant of time) is obtained by taking n = 1.

Angular Frequency and Frequency Fig. 15.7 shows again a sinusoidal plot. It describes not the shape of the wave at a certain instant but the displacement of an element (at any fixed location) of the medium as a function of time. We may for, simplicity, take Eq. (15.2) with (1) = O and monitor the motion of the element say at x = 0 . We then get y(0, t) = a sin(—a)t) = —a sin wt <—T—> Fig. 15.7 An element of a string at a ﬁxed location oscillates in time with amplitude a and period T, as the wave passes over it. Now, the period of oscillation of the wave is the time it takes for an element to complete one full oscillation. That is —a sin cat = —a sin w(t + T) = —a sin(a)t + wT) Since sine function repeats after every 271;, 27; wT = 27: 01‘ a): T (15.7) 0) is called the angular frequency of the wave. Its SI unit is rad 3'1. The frequency v is the number of oscillations per second. Therefore, 1 a) V : _ : _ T 27r V is usually measured in hertz. In the discussion above, reference has always been made to a wave travelling along a string or a transverse wave. In a longitudinal wave, the displacement of an element of the medium is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. In Eq. (15.2), the displacement function for a longitudinal wave is written as, s(x, t) = a sin (kx— cot + (p) (15.9) (15.8) where s(x, t) is the displacement of an element of the medium in the direction of propagation of the wave at position xand time t. In Eq. (15.9), a is the displacement amplitude; other quantities have the same meaning as in case of a transverse wave except that the displacement function y (x, t) is to be replaced by the function 5 (x, t). * Here again, ‘radian’ could be dropped and the units could be written merely as m’l. Thus, k represents 27: times the number of waves (or the total phase difference) that can be accommodated per unit length, with SI units m‘1. 2019-20",0

These plasmid DNA act as vectors to transfer the piece of DNA attached to it. You probably know that mosquito acts as an insect vector to transfer the malarial parasite into human body. In the same way, a plasmid can be used as vector to deliver an alien piece of DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene with the plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase, which acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new combination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created in vitro and is known as recombinant DNA. When this DNA is transferred into Escherichia coli, a bacterium closely related to Salmonella, it could replicate using the new host’s DNA polymerase enzyme and make multiple copies. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in E. coli was called cloning of antibiotic resistance gene in E. coli. You can hence infer that there are three basic steps in genetically modifying an organism — (i) identiﬁcation of DNA with desirable genes; (ii) introduction of the identiﬁed DNA into the host; (iii) maintenance of introduced DNA in the host and transfer of the DNA to its progeny. 11.2 TOOLS OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY Now we know from the foregoing discussion that genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technology can be accomplished only if we have the key tools, i.e., restriction enzymes, polymerase enzymes, ligases, vectors and the host organism. Let us try to understand some of these in detail. 1 1.2. 1 Restriction Enzymes In the year 1963, the two enzymes responsible for restricting the growth of bacteriophage in Escherichia coli were isolated. One of these added methyl groups to DNA, while the other cut DNA. The later was called restriction endonuclease. The first restriction endonuclease—H ind 11, whose functioning depended on a speciﬁc DNA nucleotide sequence was isolated and characterised ﬁve years later. It was found that Hind II always out DNA molecules at a particular point by recognising a speciﬁc sequence of six base pairs. This specific base sequence is known as the recognition sequence for Hind 11. Besides Hind 11, today we know more than 900 restriction enzymes that have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria each of which recognise different recognition sequences. The convention for naming these enzymes is the ﬁrst letter of the name comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of the prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated, e.g., EcoRI comes from Escherichia coli RY 13.

Sexual spores are called ascospores which are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These asci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps. Some examples are Aspergillus Wigure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora. Neurospora is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many members like morels and trufﬂes are edible and are considered delicacies. 2.3.3 Basidiomycetes Commonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket fungi or puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in living plant bodies as parasites, e. g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branched and septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetative reproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent, but plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic cells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryotic which ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis take place in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiospores are exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia). The basidia are arranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common members are Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.50), Ustilago (smut) and Puccinia (rust fungus). 2.3.4 Deuteromycetes Commonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual or vegetative phases of these fungi are known. When the sexual forms of these fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightly belong to. It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage have been given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexual stage another (and placed under another class). Later when the linkages were established, the fungi were correctly identified and moved out of deuteromycetes. Once perfect (sexual) stages of members of dueteromycetes were discovered they were often moved to ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual spores known as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched. Some members are saprophytes or parasites while a large number of them are decomposers of litter and help in mineral cycling. Some examples are Alternaria, Colletotrichum and Trichoderma.",1
25,925,"STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION All the above examples involve sources of resistance genes that are in the same crop species, which has to be bred for disease resistance, or in a related wild species. Transfer of resistance genes is achieved by sexual hybridisation between the target and the source plant followed by selection. 9.2.3 Plant Breeding for Developing Resistance to Insect Pests Another major cause for large scale destruction of crop plant and crop produce is insect and pest infestation. Insect resistance in host crop plants may be due to morphological, biochemical or physiological characteristics. Hairy leaves in several plants are associated with resistance to insect pests, e. g, resistance to j assids in cotton and cereal leaf beetle in wheat. In wheat, solid stems lead to non-preference by the stem sawﬂy and smooth leaved and nectar-less cotton varieties do not attract bollworms. High aspartic acid, low nitrogen and sugar content in maize leads to resistance to maize stem borers. Breeding methods for insect pest resistance involve the same steps as those for any other agronomic trait such as yield or quality and are as discussed earlier. Sources of resistance genes may be cultivated varieties, germplasm collections of the crop or wild relatives. Some released crop varieties bred by hybridisation and selection, for insect pest resistance are given in Table 9.2.

A far greater number— three billion people — suffer from micronutrient, protein and vitamin deﬁciencies or ‘hidden hunger’ because they cannot afford to buy enough fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish and meat. Diets lacking essential micronutrients — particularly iron, Vitamin A, iodine and zinc — increase the risk for disease, reduce lifespan and reduce mental abilities. 2019—2020 I75",1
26,1321,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 19 Though the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complex in behaviour. Compared to many other organisms, bacteria as a group show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria are autotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates. They may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic. The vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on other organisms or on dead organic matter for food. 2. 1 . 1 Archaebacteria ’Ihese bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats such as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles) and marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria in having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for their survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut of several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are responsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these animals. 2. 1 .2 Eubacteria There are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true bacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a rigid cell wall, and if motile, a ﬂagellum. The cyanobacteria (also referred to as blue- green algae) have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are photosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The cyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or ﬁlamentous, freshwater / marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies are generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They often form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of these organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in specialised cells called heterocysts, e. g., Nostoc and Anabaena. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria oxidise various inorganic substances such as nitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released energy for their ATP production. They play a great role in recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, iron and sulphur. Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in nature. The majority are important decomposers. Many of them have a signiﬁcant impact on human affairs. They are helpful in making curd from milk, production of antibiotics, ﬁxing nitrogen in legume Figure 2.2 A ﬁlamentous blue-green algae — Nostoc",1

(provided food and space remain unlimited) (ii) Logistic growth: No population of any species in nature has at its disposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth. This leads to competition between individuals for limited resources. Eventually, the ‘ﬁttest’ individual will survive and reproduce. The governments of many countries have also realised this fact and introduced various restraints with a view to limit human population growth. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support a maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is possible. Let us call this limit as nature’s carrying capacity (K) for that species in that habitat. A population growing in a habitat with limited resources show initially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration and ﬁnally an asymptote, when the population density reaches the carrying capacity. A plot of N in relation to time (t) results in a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called Verhulst—Pearl Logistic Growth (Figure 13.6) and is described by the following equation: K—N = N — dN/dt 1' ( K ) Where N = Population density at time t r = Intrinsic rate of natural increase K = Carrying capacity Since resources for growth for most animal populations are ﬁnite and become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model is considered a more realistic one.

Rice is an important food grain, the presence of which goes back thousands of years in Asia’s agricultural history. There are an estimated 200,000 varieties of rice in India alone. The diversity of rice in India is one of the richest in the world. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique aroma and ﬂavour and 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown in India. There is reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and poetry, as it has been grown for centuries. In 1997, an American company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce. This allowed the company to sell a ‘new’ variety of Basmati, in the US and abroad. This ‘new’ variety of Basmati had actually been derived from Indian farmer’s varieties. Indian Basmati was crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or a novelty. The patent extends to functional equivalents, implying that other people selling Basmati rice could be restricted by the patent. Several attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines, e.g., turmeric neem. If we are not vigilant and we do not immediately counter these patent applications, other countries/ individuals may encash on our rich legacy and we may not be able to do anything about it. Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organisations without proper authorisation from the countries and people concerned without compensatory payment. Most of the industrialised nations are rich ﬁnancially but poor in biodiversity and traditional knowledge. In contrast the developing and the underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional knowledge related to bio-resources. Traditional knowledge related to bio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications and can also be used to save time, effort and expenditure during their commercialisation. There has been growing realisation of the injustice, inadequate compensation and beneﬁt sharing between developed and developing countries. Therefore, some nations are developing laws to prevent such unauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional knowledge. The Indian Parliament has recently cleared the second amendment of the Indian Patents Bill, that takes such issues into consideration, including patent terms emergency provisions and research and development initiative. 2019—2020",1
30,1279,"Rate of photosynthesis 222 BIOLOGY 13. 10 FACTORS AFFECTING PHOTOSYNTHESIS An understanding of the factors that affect photosynthesis is necessary. The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of plants including crop plants. Photosynthesis is under the inﬂuence of several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include the number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplasts, internal CO2 concentration and the amount of chlorophyll. The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition and the growth of the plant. The external factors would include the availability of sunlight, temperature, CO2 concentration and water. As a plant photosynthesises, all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several factors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO2 ﬁxation, usually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate. Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels. When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s (1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following: If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed. For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light and CO2 conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal temperature, will start photosynthesising. 13.1o.1 Light We need to distinguish between light quality, light intensity and the duration of exposure to light, while discussing light as a factor that affects photosynthesis. There is a linear relationship between incident light and CO2 ﬁxation rates at low light intensities. At higher light intensities, gradually the rate does not show further increase as other factors become limiting (Figure 13.10). Light intenSitY What is interesting to note is that light saturation occurs at 10 per cent of the full sunlight. Hence, Figure 13. 10 Graph of light intensity on the except for plants in shade or in dense forests, light rate of photosynthesis is rarely a limiting factor in nature. Increase in",1

Mucus in saliva helps in lubricating and adhering the masticated food particles into a bolus. ’Ihe bolus is then conveyed into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus by swallowing or deglutition. The bolus further passes down through the oesophagus by successive waves of muscular contractions called peristalsis. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter controls the passage of food into the stomach.The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains electrolytes (Na"", K*, CI', H005) and enzymes, salivary amylase and lysozyme.

A simple experiment, called girdling, was used to identify the tissues through which food is transported. On the trunk of a tree a ring of bark up to a depth of the phloem layer, can be carefully removed. In the absence of downward movement of food the portion of the bark above the ring on the stem becomes swollen after a few weeks. This simple experiment shows that phloem is the tissue responsible for translocation of food; and that transport takes place in one direction, i.e., towards the roots. This experiment can be performed by you easily. SUMMARY Plants obtain a variety of inorganic elements (ions) and salts from their surroundings especially from water and soil. The movement of these nutrients from environment into the plant as well as from one plant cell to another plant cell essentially involves movement across a cell membrane. Transport across cell membrane can be through diffusion, facilitated transport or active transport. Water and minerals absorbed by roots are transported by xylem and the organic material synthesised in the leaves 1s transported to other parts of plant through phloem. Passive transport (diffusr, Vosmos1s) and.act1ve transport are the two modes ’ ""n"" living organisms.

Osmosis; the special ype of diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane whrchidepends on pressure gradient and concentration gradient. In active transport energy in the form of ATP is utilised to pump molecules against a concentration gradient across membranes. Water potential 1s the potential energi ofwatEr molecules which helps 1n the movement of water It' 1s determined by solute p‘oLential and pressure potential. The osmotic behaviour of cells depends on the surrounding solution. If the surrounding solution of the cell is hypertonic, it gets plasmolysed. The absorption of water by seeds and drywood takes place by a special type of diffusion called imbibition. In higher plants, there is a vascular system comprising of xylem and phloem, responsible for translocation. Water minerals and food cannot be moved within the body of a plant by diffusion alone. They are therefore, transported by a mass ﬂow system — movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. Water absorbed by root hairs moves into the root tissue by two distinct pathways, i.e., apoplast and symplast. Various ions, and water from soil can be transported upto a small height in stems by root pressure. Transpiration pull model is the most acceptable to explain the transport of water.

This happens because the motion here involves change in direction so that the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. This shows that speed is, in general, greater than the magnitude of the velocity. 4 If the car in Example 3.1 moves from O to P and comes back to O in the same time interval, average speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity is zero ! 3.4 INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED The average velocity tells us how fast an object has been moving over a given time interval but does not tell us how fast it moves at different instants of time during that interval.

40,1374,"ANIMAL KINGDOM Echinoderms and Chordates, organs have associated to form functional systems, each system concerned with a speciﬁc physiological function. This pattern is called organ system level of organisation. Organ systems in different groups of animals exhibit various patterns of complexities. For example, the digestive system in Platyhelminthes has only a single opening to the outside of the body that serves as both mouth and anus, and is hence called incomplete. A complete digestive system has two openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the circulatory system may be of two types: (i) open type in which the blood is pumped out of the heart and the cells and tissues are directly bathed in it and (ii) closed type in which the blood is circulated through a series of vessels of valying diameters (arteries, veins and capillaries). 4. 1 .2 Symmetry Animals can be categorised on the basis of their symmetry. Sponges are mostly asymmetrical, i.e., any plane that passes through the centre does not divide them into equal halves. When any plane passing through the central axis of the body divides the organism into two identical halves, it is called radial symmetry. Coelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms have this kind of body plan (Figure 4. 1a). Animals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where the body can be divided into identical left and right halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateral symmetry (Figure 4.1b). 4.1.3 Diploblastic and Triploblastic Organisation Animals in which the cells are arranged in two embryonic layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm, are called diploblastic animals, e.g., coelenterates.

Make a hole in the cork sufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly. Slide the rod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on the lower side and ball end projecting above the cork. Fold a small, thin aluminium foil (about 6 cm in length) in the middle and attach it to the ﬂattened end of the rod by cellulose tape. This forms the leaves of your electroscope. Fit the cork in the bottle with about 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork. A paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance to measure the separation of leaves. The separation is a rough measure of the amount of charge on the electroscope. To understand how the electroscope works, use the White paper strips we used for seeing the (b) attraction of charged bodies.

This shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold it into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each other. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the curtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is |:| transferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the (a) halves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The divergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them. Let us first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge. You know that all matter is made up of atoms and / or molecules. Although normally the materials are electrically neutral, they do contain charges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the (b) molecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is therefore essential that we (C) learn more about such a force.

Consider a horizontal cylinder with a piston and three vertical tubes at different points [Fig. 10.6 (a)]. The pressure in the horizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of liquid column in the vertical tubes. It is necessarily the same in all. If we push the piston, the ﬂuid level rises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level in each one of them. Fig 1 0.6 (a) Whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a ﬂuid in a vessel, it is equally transmitted in all directions. This indicates that when the pressure on the cylinder was increased, it was distributed uniformly throughout. We can say whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a ﬂuid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted undiminished and equally in all directions. This is another form of the Pascal’s law and it has many applications in daily life. A number of devices, such as hydraulic lift and hydraulic brakes, are based on the Pascal’s law. In these devices, ﬂuids are used for transmitting pressure. In a hydraulic lift, as shown in Fig. 10.6 (b), two pistons are separated by the space ﬁlled with a liquid. A piston of small cross-section A1 is used to exert a force F1 directly F on the liquid. The pressure P = All is transmitted throughout the liquid to the larger cylinder attached with a larger piston of area A2, which results in an upward force of P X A2. Therefore, the piston is capable of supporting a large force (large weight of, say a car, or a truck, Archemedes' Principle Fluid appears to provide partial support to the objects placed in it. When a body is wholly or partially immersed in a ﬂuid at rest. the ﬂuid exerts pressure on the surface of the body in contact with the ﬂuid. The pressure is greater on lower surfaces of the body than on the upper surfaces as pressure in a ﬂuid increases with depth. The resultant of all the forces is an upward force called buoyant force. Suppose that a cylindrical body is immersed in the ﬂuid. The upward force on the bottom of the body is more than the downward force on its top. The ﬂuid exerts a resultant upward force or buoyant force on the body equal to (P2— P1] x A (Fig. 10.3]. We have seen in equation 10.4 that [PZ—P1]A = pghA. Now. hA ls the volume of the solid and phA is the weight of an equivaliant volume of the ﬂuid. (PQ—P1)A = mg. Thus. the upward force exerted is equal to the weight of the displaced ﬂuid. The result holds true irrespective of the shape of the object and here cylindrical object is considered only for convenience. This is Archimedes' principle. For totally immersed objects the volume of the ﬂuid displaced by the object is equal to its own volume. If the density of the immersed object is more than that of the ﬂuid, the object will sink as the weight of the body is more than the upward thrust. If the density of the object is less than that of the ﬂuid. it ﬂoats in the ﬂuid partially submerged. To calculate the volume submerged, suppose the total volume of the object is VS and a part Vp of it is submerged in the ﬂuid. Then. the upward force which is the weight of the displaced ﬂuid is ngp, which must equal the weight of the body: p 9gVS = plngor ps/pl = Vp/Vs The apparent weight of the ﬂoating body is zero. This principle can be summarised as: ‘the loss of weight of a body submerged (partially or fully) in a ﬂuid is equal to the weight of the ﬂuid displaced‘. 2019-20",0

This list may have water, oxygen and nutrients as very essential elements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which in turn requires water. Turgidity of cells helps in extension growth. Thus, plant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water status of the plant. Water also provides the medium for enzymatic activities needed for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential for growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are required by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of energy. In addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range best suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be detrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity also affect certain phases/ stages of growth.",1

Can you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used in the equation given above? 13.3 WHERE DOES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKE PLACE? You would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf or ‘in the chloroplasts’, based on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are deﬁnitely right. Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so also in other green parts of the plants. Can you name some other parts where you think photosynthesis may occur? You would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light. When do you think the chloroplasts will be aligned with their ﬂat surfaces parallel to the walls? When would they be perpendicular to the incident light? You have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within the chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 13.2). There is a clear division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light driven are called light reactions (photochemical reactions). The latter are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as dark reactions (carbon reactions). However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent.

49,787,"PLANT KINGDOM Bryophytes are also called amphibians of the plant kingdom because these plants can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities. They play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks / soil. The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum by unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or leaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The main plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence is called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular. The male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biﬂagellate antherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is ﬂask-shaped and produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where they come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the egg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division immediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte. The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic gametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the sporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid spores. These spores germinate to produce gametophyte. Bryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some mosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals. Species of Sphagnum a moss, provide peat that have long been used as fuel, and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because of their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the ﬁrst organisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance. They decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of higher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the impact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses. 3.2. 1 Liverworts The liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks of streams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods. The plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e. g., Marchantia. The thallus is dorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy members have tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures. Asexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation of thalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called gemmae (sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, which develop in small receptacles called gemma cups located on the thalli. The gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate to form new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex 35",1

An image is thus a point-to-point correspondence with the object established through reﬂection and / or refraction. In principle, we can take any two rays emanating from a point on an object, trace their paths, find their point of intersection and thus, obtain the image of the point due to reﬂection at a spherical mirror. In practice, however, it is convenient to choose any two of the following rays: (i) The ray from the point which is parallel to the principal axis. The reﬂected ray goes through the focus of the mirror. (ii) The ray passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror or appearing to pass through it for a convex mirror. The reﬂected ray simply retraces the path. (iii) The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave mirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus of a convex mirror. The reﬂected ray is parallel to the principal axis. (iv) The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reﬂected ray follows laws of reﬂection. Figure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows the image A’B’ (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave mirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A. An infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions. Thus, point A’ is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and falling on the concave mirror after reﬂection passes through the point A’. We now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object distance (u), image distance (D) and the focal length (f).

53,1442,"WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE long. Such rain is common in the summer or in the hotter part of the day. It is very common in the equatorial regions and interior parts of the continents, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Orographic Rain When the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands; the temperature falls, and the moisture is condensed. The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the windward slopes receive greater rainfall. After giving rain on the windward side, when these winds reach the other slope, they descend, and their temperature rises. Then their capacity to take in moisture increases and hence, these leeward slopes remain rainless and dry. The area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the rain-shadow area. It is also known as the relief rain. Cyclonic Rain You have already read about extra tropical cyclones and cyclonic rain in Chapter 10. Please consult Chapter 10 to understand cyclonic rainfall. World Distribution of Rainfall Different places on the earth’s surface receive different amounts of rainfall in a year and that too in different seasons. In general, as we proceed from the equator towards the poles, rainfall goes on decreasing steadily. The coastal areas of the world receive greater amounts of rainfall than the interior of 97 the continents. The rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of the world because of being great sources of water. Between the latitudes 35° and 400 N and S of the equator, the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts and goes on decreasing towards the west. But, between 450 and 650 N and S of equator, due to the westerlies, the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east. Wherever mountains run parallel to the coast, the rain is greater on the coastal plain, on the windward side and it decreases towards the leeward side. On the basis of the total amount of annual precipitation, major precipitation regimes of the world are identified as follows. The equatorial belt, the windward slopes of the mountains along the western coasts in the cool temperate zone and the coastal areas of the monsoon land receive heavy rainfall of over 200 cm per annum. Interior continental areas receive moderate rainfall varying from 100 - 200 cm per annum. The coastal areas of the continents receive moderate amount of rainfall. The central parts of the tropical land and the eastern and interior parts of the temperate lands receive rainfall varying between 50 - 100 cm per annum. Areas lying in the rain shadow zone of the interior of the continents and high latitudes receive very low rainfall-less than 50 cm per annum. Seasonal distribution of rainfall provides an important aspect to judge its effectiveness. In some regions rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year such as in the equatorial belt and in the western parts of cool temperate regions. EXERCISES 1. Multiple choice questions.

54,1328,"44 BIOLOGY The gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore these plants are called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce microspores and megaspores which are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia borne on the sporophylls. The sporophylls — microsporophylls and megasporophylls — are arranged spirally on axis to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen grain gerrninates and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it fuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops into embryo and the ovules into seeds. In angiosperms, the male sex organs (stamen) and female sex organs (pistil) are borne in a ﬂower. Each stamen consists of a ﬁlament and an anther. The anther produces pollen grains (male gametophyte) after meiosis. The pistil consists of an ovary enclosing one to many ovules. Within the ovule is the female gametophyte or embryo sac which contains the egg cell. The pollen tube enters the embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged.

There is also another unit named “curie” that is widely used and is related to the 81 unit as: Marie Sklodowska Curie [1867-1934) Born in Poland. She is recognised both as a physicist and as a chemist. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired Marie and her husband Pierre Curie in their researches and analyses which led to the isolation of radium and polonium elements. She was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes- for Physics in 1903 and for Chemistry in 191 1. 1 curie = 1 Ci = 3.7 X 1010 decays per second = 3.7 x 1010 Bq Different radionuclides differ greatly in their rate of decay. A common way to characterize this feature is through the notion of half-life. Half-life of a radionuclide (denoted by 71/2) is the time it takes for a sample that has initially, say NO radionuclei to reduce to NO/ 2. Putting N= N0/2 and t= T1/2in Eq. (13.14), we get _ ln2 _ 0.693 TU2 — 7 — ,1 (13.17) Clearly if N0 reduces to half its value in time T1/2’ R0 Will also reduce to half its value in the same time according to Eq. (13.16). Another related measure is the average or mean life T. This again can be obtained from Eq. (1 3.14). The number of nuclei which decay in the time interval tto t+ At is R(t)At (= woe—“An. Each of them has lived for time t. Thus the total life of all these nuclei would be thNoe‘7“t At. It is clear that some nuclei may live for a short time while others may live longer. Therefore to obtain the mean life, we have to sum (or integrate) this expression over all times from O to co , and divide by the total number N0 of nuclei at t= 0.

Viroids and Lichens C HAPTER 2 BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION Since the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classify living organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that were scientiﬁc but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use — for food, shelter and clothing. Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more scientiﬁc basis for classiﬁcation. He used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not. In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all plants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi) organisms. Classiﬁcation of organisms into plants and animals was easily done and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms did not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification used for a long time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphology a need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure, nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction, evolutionary relationships, etc. Classification systems for the living organisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time. Though plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all different systems, the understanding of what groups /organisms be included under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and nature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by different scientists over the time. 2019-2020",1
59,42,"Moving Charges and Magnetism #ONI 27tr We shall now compare the two results: for a toroid and solenoid. We re-express Eq. (4.2 1) to make the comparison easier with the solenoid result given in Eq. (4.20). Let rbe the average radius of the toroid and n be the number of turns per unit length. Then 8: (4.21) N = 2m n = (average) perimeter of the toroid X number of turns per unit length and thus, B = #0 n1, (4.22) i.e., the result for the solenoid! In an ideal toroid the coils are circular. In reality the turns of the toroidal coil form a helix and there is always a small magnetic ﬁeld external to the toroid. MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT We have seen in Section 4.3 (see also the box on helical motion of charged particles earlier in this chapter) that orbits of charged particles are helical. If the magnetic field is non-uniform, but does not change much during one circular orbit, then the radius of the helix will decrease as it enters stronger magnetic ﬁeld and the radius will increase when it enters weaker magnetic ﬁelds. We consider two solenoids at a distance from each other, enclosed in an evacuated container (see ﬁgure below where we have not shown the container). Charged particles moving in the region between the two solenoids will start with a small radius. The radius will increase as ﬁeld decreases and the radius will decrease again as ﬁeld due to the second solenoid takes over. The solenoids act as a mirror or reﬂector. [See the direction of F as the particle approaches coil 2 in the ﬁgure. It has a horizontal component against the forward motion.] This makes the particles turn back when they approach the solenoid. Such an arrangement will act like magnetic bottle or magnetic container. The particles will never touch the sides of the container. Such magnetic bottles are of great use in confining the high energy plasma in fusion experiments. The plasma will destroy any other form of material container because of its high temperature. Another useful container is a toroid. Toroids are expected to play a key role in the tokamak, an equipment for plasma conﬁnement in fusion power reactors. There is an international collaboration called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), being set up in France, for achieving controlled fusion, of which India is a collaborating nation.

FSH stimulates growth and development of the ovarian follicles in females. MSH acts on the melanocytes (melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentation of the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth muscles of our body and stimulates their contraction. In females, it stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at the time of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammary gland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney and stimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by the distal tubules and thereby reduces loss of water through urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). An impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADH results in a diminished ability of the kidney to conserve water leading to water loss and dehydration. This condition is known as Diabetes Insipidus. 22.2.3 The Pineal Gland The pineal gland is located on the dorsal side of forebrain. Pineal secretes a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin plays a very important role in the regulation of a 24-hour (diurnal) rhythm of our body. For example, it helps in maintaining the normal rhythms of sleep-wake cycle, body temperature. In addition, melatonin also inﬂuences metabolism, pigmentation, the menstrual cycle as well as our defense capability. 22.2.4 Thyroid Gland The thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are located on either side of the trachea (Figure 22.3). Both the lobes are interconnected with a thin ﬂap of connective tissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed of follicles and stromal tissues. Each thyroid follicle is composed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. These follicular cells synthesise two hormones, tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Iodine is essential for the normal rate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deﬁciency of iodine in our diet results in hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly called goitre. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causes defective development and maturation of the growing",1

AND SIMP * 14. 1 INTRODUCTION Devices in which a controlled ﬂow of electrons can be obtained are the basic building blocks of all the electronic circuits. Before the discovery of transistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called valves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz. anode (often called plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes — cathode, plate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes). In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and the controlled ﬂow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying the voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the inter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their energy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices the electrons can ﬂow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one direction). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as values. These vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate generally at high voltages (~ 100 V) and have limited life and low reliability. The seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor electronics goes back to 1930’s when it was realised that some solid- state semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling the number and the direction of ﬂow of charge carriers through them. Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change the number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply 2019-20",0

Pituitary, pineal, ThYIOid and thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, Parathymid thymus and gonads (testis in males and ovary in females) are the organised Thymus endocrine bodies in our body Wigure 22.1). In addition to these, some other organs, e. g., gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, heart also produce hormones. A brief account of the Adrenal structure and functions of all major endocrine glands and hypothalamus of the human body is given in the following sections. Hypothalamus Pituitary Pancreas Ovary . (in female) 5 Testis 22.2. 1 The Hypothalamus As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of grth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2). Figure 22.1 Location of endocrine glands",1
64,1597,"Cash Flow Statement 237 6.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents As stated earlier, cash ﬂow statement shows inﬂows and outﬂows of cash and cash equivalents from various activities of an enterprise during a particular period. As per AS-3, ‘Cash' comprises cash in hand and demand deposits with banks, and ‘Cash equivalents' means short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. An investment normally qualiﬁes as cash equivalents only when it has a short maturity, of say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. Investments in shares are excluded from cash equivalents unless they are in substantial cash equivalents. For example, preference shares of a company acquired shortly before their speciﬁc redemption date, provided there is only insignificant risk of failure of the company to repay the amount at maturity. Similarly, short-term marketable securities which can be readily converted into cash are treated as cash equivalents and is liquidable immediately without considerable change in value. 6.4 Cash Flows ‘Cash Flows' implies movement of cash in and out due to some non—cash items. Receipt of cash from a non—cash item is termed as cash inﬂow while cash payment in respect of such items as cash outﬂow. For example, purchase of machinery by paying cash is cash outﬂow while sale proceeds received from sale of machinery is cash inﬂow. Other examples of cash ﬂows include collection of cash from trade receivables, payment to trade payables, payment to employees, receipt of dividend, interest payments, etc. Cash management includes the investment of excess cash in cash equivalents. Hence, purchase of marketable securities or short-term investment which constitutes cash equivalents is not considered while preparing cash ﬂow statement. 6.5 Classification of Activities for the Preparation of Cash Flow Statement You know that various activities of an enterprise result into cash ﬂows (inﬂows or receipts and outﬂows or payments) which is the subject matter of a cash ﬂow statement. As per AS—3, these activities are to be classiﬁed into three categories: (1) operating, (2) investing, and (3) ﬁnancing activities so as to show separately the cash ﬂows generated (or used) by (in) these activities. This helps the users of cash ﬂow statement to assess the impact of these activities on the ﬁnancial position of an enterprise and also on its cash and cash equivalents.",3

In return for the favour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae. Orchids show a bewildering diversity of ﬂoral patterns many of which have evolved to attract the right pollinator insect (bees and bumblebees) and ensure guaranteed pollination by it (Figure l 3.8). Not all orchids offer rewards. The Mediterranean orchid Ophrys employs ‘sexual deceit’ to get pollination done by a species of bee. One petal of its ﬂower bears an uncanny resemblance to the female of the bee in size, colour and markings. The male bee is attracted to what it perceives as a female, ‘pseudocopulates’ with the ﬂower, and during that process is dusted with pollen from the ﬂower. When this same bee ‘pseudocopulates’ with another ﬂower, it transfers pollen to it and thus, pollinates the ﬂower. Here you can see how co-evolution operates. If the female bee’s colour patterns change even slightly for any reason during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the orchid ﬂower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the female bee. SUMMARY 238 wmv As a branch of biology, Ecologr is the study of the relationships of living organisms with the abiotic (physico-chemical factors) and biotic components (other species) of their environment. It is concerned with four levels of biological organisation-organisms, populations, communities and biomes. Temperature, light, water and soil are the most important physical factors of the environment to which the organisms are adapted in various ways. Maintenance of a constant internal environment (homeostasis) by the organisms contributes to optimal performance, but only some organisms (regulators) are capable of homeostasis in the face of changing external environment. Others either partially regulate their internal environment or simply conform. A few other species have evolved adaptations to avoid unfavourable conditions in space (migration) or in time (aestivation, hibernation, and diapause). Evolutionary changes through natural selection take place at the population level and hence, population ecology is an important area of ecology. A population is a group of individuals of a given species sharing or competing for similar resources in a defined geographical area. Populations have attributes that individual organisms do not- birth rates and death rates, sex ratio and age 2019—2020",1

They are made to pass through a cylinder with fine holes along its axis, producing a fine collimated beam. The beam is made to fall on the surface of a nickel crystal. The electrons are scattered in all directions by the atoms of the crystal. The intensity of the electron beam, scattered in a given direction, is measured by the electron detector (collector). The detector can be moved on a circular scale and is connected to a sensitive galvanometer, which records the current. The deﬂection of the galvanometer is proportional to the intensity of the electron beam entering the collector. The apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated chamber. By moving the detector on the circular scale at different positions, the intensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for different values of angle of scattering 0 which is the angle between the incident and the scattered electron beams. The variation of the intensity (I) of the scattered electrons with the angle of scattering 0 is obtained for different accelerating voltages. The experiment was performed by varying the accelarating voltage from 44 V to 68 V. It was noticed that a strong peak appeared in the intensity (I) of the scattered electron for an accelarating voltage of 54V at a scattering angle 6 = 50° The appearance of the peak in a particular direction is due to the constructive interference of electrons scattered from different layers of the regularly spaced atoms of the crystals. From the electron diffraction measurements, the wavelength of matter waves was found to be 0.165 nm. The de Broglie wavelength 2. associated with electrons, using Eq. (1 1.1 1), for V= 54 V is given by 1 227 JV A=h/p= nm 2. 1 227 O 167 = nm = . nm \/54 Thus, there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical value and the experimentally obtained value of de Broglie wavelength. Davisson- Gerrner experiment thus strikingly conﬁrms the wave nature of electrons and the de Broglie relation. More recently, in 1989, the wave nature of a beam of electrons was experimentally demonstrated in a double-slit experiment, similar to that used for the wave nature of light. Also, in an experiment in 1994, interference fringes were obtained with the beams of iodine molecules, which are about a million times more massive than electrons. The de Broglie hypothesis has been basic to the development of modern quantum mechanics. It has also led to the ﬁeld of electron optics. The wave properties of electrons have been utilised in the design of electron microscope which is a great improvement, with higher resolution, over the optical microscope. 2019-20",0

Most of them have two ﬂagella; one lies longitudinally and the other transversely in a furrow between the wall plates. Very often, red dinoﬂagellates (Example: Gonyaulax) undergo such rapid multiplication that they make the sea appear red (red tides). Toxins released by such large numbers may even kill other marine animals such as ﬁshes. 2.2.3 Euglenoids Majority of them are fresh water organisms found in stagnant water. Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein rich layer called pellicle which makes their body ﬂexible. They have two ﬂagella, a short and a long one.

For example, let all black stripes have a width of 5 mm. Let the width of the ﬁrst two white stripes be 0.5 mm each, the next two white stripes be 1 mm each, the next two 1.5 mm each, etc. Paste this pattern on a wall in a room or laboratory, at the height of your eye. Now watch the pattern, preferably with one eye. By moving away or closer to the wall, ﬁnd the position where you can just see some two black stripes as separate stripes. All the black stripes to the left of this stripe would merge into one another and would not be distinguishable. On the other hand, the black stripes to the right of this would be more and more clearly visible. Note the width d of the white stripe which separates the two regions, and measure the distance D of the wall from your eye. Then d/ D is the resolution of your eye.

74,1059,"STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 7. 1 . 1 Epithelial Tissue We commonly refer to an epithelial tissue as epithelium (pl.: epithelia). This tissue has a free surface, which faces either a body ﬂuid or the outside environment and thus provides a covering or a lining for some part of the body. The cells are compactly packed with little intercellular matrix. There are two types of epithelial tissues namely simple epithelium and compound epithelium. Simple epithelium is composed of a single layer of cells and functions as a lining for body cavities, ducts, and tubes. The compound epithelium consists of two or more cell layers and has protective function as it does in our skin. On the basis of structural modiﬁcation of the cells, simple epithelium is further divided into three types. These are (i) Squamous, (ii) Cuboidal, (iii) Columnar (Figure 7 . 1). Figure 7.1 Simple epithelium: (a) Squamous (b) Cuboidal (c) Columnar (d) Columnar cells bearing cilia The squamous epithelium is made of a single thin layer of ﬂattened cells with irregular boundaries. They are found in the walls of blood vessels and air sacs of lungs and are involved in functions like forming a diffusion boundary. The cuboidal epithelium is composed of a single layer of cube-like cells. This is commonly found in ducts of glands and tubular parts of nephrons in kidneys and its main functions are secretion and absorption. The epithelium of proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of nephron in the kidney has microvilli. The columnar epithelium is composed of a single layer of tall and slender cells. Their nuclei are located at the base. Free surface may have microvilli. They are found in the lining of stomach and intestine and help in secretion and absorption. If the columnar or cuboidal cells bear cilia on their free surface they are called ciliated epithelium (Figure 7 . 1d). Their function is to move particles or mucus in a speciﬁc direction over the epithelium. They are mainly present in the inner surface of hollow organs like bronchioles and fallopian tubes. 101",1
75,641,"Duol Nature of Radiation and Mo’r’rer Every body at any temperature emits radiation of all wavelengths. It also absorbs radiation falling on it. A body which absorbs all the radiation falling on it is called a black body. It is an ideal concept in physics, like concepts of a point mass or uniform motion. A graph of the intensity of radiation emitted by a body versus wavelength is called the black body spectrum No theory in those days could explain the complete black body spectrum! In 1900, Planck hit upon a novel idea. If we assume, he said, that radiation is emitted in packets of energy instead of continuously as in a wave, then we can explain the black body spectrum. Planck himself regarded these quanta, or packets, as a property of emission and absorption, rather than that of light. He derived a formula which agreed with the entire spectrum. This was a confusing mixture of wave and particle pictures — radiation is emitted as a particle, it travels as a wave, and is again absorbed as a particle! Moreover, this put physicists in a dilemma. Should we again accept the particle picture of light just to explain one phenomenon? Then what happens to the phenomena of interference and diffraction which cannot be explained by the particle model? But soon in 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by assuming the particle picture of light. In 1907, Debye explained the low temperature specific heats of solids by using the particle picture for lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. Both these phenomena belonging to widely diverse areas of physics could be explained only by the particle model and not by the wave model. In 1923, Compton’s x—ray scattering experiments from atoms also went in favour of the particle picture. This increased the dilemma further. Thus by 1923, physicists faced with the following situation. (a) There were some phenomena like rectilinear propagation, reﬂection, refraction, which could be explained by either particle model or by wave model. (b) There were some phenomena such as diffraction and interference which could be explained only by the wave model but not by the particle model. (c) There were some phenomena such as black body radiation, photoelectric effect, and Compton scattering which could be explained only by the particle model but not by the wave model. Somebody in those days aptly remarked that light behaves as a particle on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and as a wave on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and we don't talk of light on Sundays! In 1924, de Broglie proposed his theory of wave—particle duality in which he said that not only photons of light but also ‘particles’ of matter such as electrons and atoms possess a dual character, sometimes behaving like a particle and sometimes as a wave. He gave a formula connecting their mass, velocity, momentum (particle characteristics), with their wavelength and frequency [wave characteristics)! In 1927 Thomson, and Davisson and Germer, in separate experiments, showed that electrons did behave like waves with a wavelength which agreed with that given by de Broglie’s formula. Their experiment was on diffraction of electrons through crystalline solids, in which the regular arrangement of atoms acted like a grating. Very soon, diffraction experiments with other ‘particles’ such as neutrons and protons were performed and these too confirmed with de Broglie’s formula. This confirmed wave—particle duality as an established principle of physics. Here was a principle, physicists thought, which explained all the phenomena mentioned above not only for light but also for the so—called particles. But there was no basic theoretical foundation for wave—particle duality. De Broglie’s proposal was merely a qualitative argument based on symmetry of nature. Wave—particle duality was at best a principle, not an outcome of a sound fundamental theory. It is true that all experiments whatever agreed with de Broglie formula. But physics does not work that way. On the one hand, it needs experimental confirmation, while on the other hand, it also needs sound theoretical basis for the models proposed. This was developed over the next two decades. Dirac developed his theory of radiation in about 1928, and Heisenberg and Pauli gave it a firm footing by 1930. Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman, in late 1940s, produced further refinements and cleared the theory of inconsistencies which were noticed. All these theories mainly put wave—particle duality on a theoretical footing. Although the story continues, it grows more and more complex and beyond the scope of this note. But we have here the essential structure of what happened, and let us be satisfied with it at the moment. Now it is regarded as a natural consequence of present theories of physics that electromagnetic radiation as well as particles of matter exhibit both wave and particle properties in different experiments, and sometimes even in the different parts of the same experiment. 413 2019-20",0
76,918,"BIOMOLECULES 151 9.8 NATURE OF BOND LINKING MONOMERS IN A POLYMER In a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide bond which is formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino acid reacts with the amino (-NHZ) group of the next amino acid with the elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration). In a polysaccharide the individual monosaccharides are linked by a glycosidic bond. This bond is also formed by dehydration. This bond is formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides. In a nucleic acid a phosphate moiety links the 3’-carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide to the 5’-carbon of the sugar of the succeeding nucleotide. The bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of sugar is an ester bond. As there is one such ester bond on either side, it is called phosphodiester bond (Figure 9.5). Nucleic acids exhibit a wide variety of secondary structures. For example, one of the secondary structures exhibited by DNA is the famous Watson-Crick model. This model says that DNA exists as a double helix. The two strands of polynucleotides are antiparallel i.e., run in the opposite direction. The backbone is formed by the sugar- phosphate-sugar chain. The nitrogen bases are projected more or less perpendicular to this backbone but face inside. A and G of one strand compulsorily base pairs with T and C, respectively, on the other strand. 5' 3' {II |_.

This aspect is akin to capacitance which for a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation (geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium (intrinsic material property). Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M LZT‘2A‘2] given by the dimensions of ﬂux divided by the dimensions of current. The SI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H. It is named in honour of Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA, independently of Faraday in England. 6.9. 1 Mutual inductance Consider Fig. 6. 1 5 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length i. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S1 by r1 and the number of turns per unit length by n1. The corresponding quantities for the outer solenoid S2 are r2 and n2, respectively. Let N1 and N2 be the total number of turns of coils S1 and S2, respectively. When a current I2 is set up through S , it in turn sets up a magnetic ﬂux through SI. Let us denote it by (1)1. The corresponding ﬂux linkage with solenoid S1 is N1 951 = M1212 (6.9) M12 is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S1 with respect to solenoid S2. It is also referred to as the coefﬁcient of mutual induction. For these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to calculate M12. The magnetic ﬁeld due to the current I2 in S2 is ,uon212. The resulting ﬂux linkage with coil S1 is, N1? = (nil) (TU-12) (#011212) = ,uon1n27tr121 12 (6.10) where nllis the total number of turns in solenoid SI. Thus, from Eq. (6.9) and Eq.

This is a good approximation keeping in mind that the solenoid is long, implying 1 >> r2. We now consider the reverse case. A current I1 is passed through the solenoid S1 and the ﬂux linkage with coil S2 is, N243 = M I (6.12) 211 M21 is called the mutual inductance of solenoid 82 with respect to solenoid SI.

They do not have constant body temperature i.e., their body temperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals are called cold blooded or poikilotherms. You might have also noticed changes in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry land. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from their enemies (camouﬂage). This protective coloration is called mimicry. You may also know that frogs are not seen during peak summer and winter. During this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect them from extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation) and winter sleep (hibernation) respectively. 7 . 5 . 1 Morphology Have you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery due to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist condition. The colour of dorsal side of body is generally olive green with dark irregular spots. On the ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow. The frog never drinks water but absorb it through the skin. Body of a frog is divisible into head and trunk (Figure 7 . 19). A neck and tail are absent. Above the mouth, a pair of nostrils is present. Eyes are bulged and covered by a nictitating membrane that protects them while in water. On either side of eyes a membranous Head tympanum (ear) receives sound signals. The forelimbs and hind limbs help in swimming, walking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end in five digits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in four digits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual Fore 11ml) dimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the presence of sound producing vocal sacs and also a Hind limb copulatory pad on the ﬁrst digit of the fore limbs which are absent in female frogs.

We draw the ﬁgure on the plane of paper, i.e., in two- dimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes to estimate the density of ﬁeld lines, one has to consider the number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular to the lines. Since the electric ﬁeld decreases as the square of the distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the charge increases as the square of the distance, the number of ﬁeld lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant, whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge. We started by saying that the field lines carry information about the direction of electric ﬁeld at different points in space. Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density (i.e., closeness) of the ﬁeld lines at different points indicates number of ﬁeld lines. the relative strength of electric ﬁeld at those points. The ﬁeld 24 lines crowd where the ﬁeld is strong and are spaced apart where it is weak. Figure 1.16 shows a set of ﬁeld lines. We can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and S normal to the ﬁeld lines there. The number of field lines in our picture cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at these points. The picture shows that the ﬁeld at R is stronger than at S. To understand the dependence of the ﬁeld lines on the area, or rather the solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the area with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions. Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small transverse line element Al be placed at a distance r from a point 0. Then the angle subtended by Al at O can be approximated as A9 = Al/ r. Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle* subtended by a small perpendicular plane area AS, at a distance r, can be written as A52 = AS/ r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial field lines is the same. In Fig. 1.16, for two points P1 and P2 at distances r1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle A52 is 132A52 at P1 and an element of area r22A52 at P2, respectively. The number of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The number of ﬁeld lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/ ( r12 A52) at P1 and n/(r22 A52) at P2, respectively. Since n and A52 are common, the strength of the field clearly has a 1 / r2 dependence. The picture of ﬁeld lines was invented by Faraday to develop an intuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric ﬁelds around charged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is somewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic ﬁelds. The more appropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have adopted in this book. Electric ﬁeld lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric ﬁeld around a conﬁguration of charges. An electric ﬁeld line is, in general, * Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone with a sphere of radius R. The solid angle A52 of the cone is defined to be equal to AS/Rz, where AS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone. 2019-20",0
82,1230,"BIOLOGY and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of complementarity. It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and continues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the enzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in termination of transcription. An intriguing question is that how is the RNA polymerases able to catalyse all the three steps, which are initiation, elongation and termination. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the process of elongation. It associates transiently With initiation-factor (o) and termination-factor (p) to initiate and terminate the transcription, respectively. Association With these factors alter the specificity of the RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 6.10). In bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become active, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria), many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria.

When the acceleration is uniform, obviously, it equals the average acceleration over that period. Since velocity is a quantity having both magnitude and direction, a change in velocity may involve either or both of these factors. Acceleration, therefore, may result from a change in speed (magnitude), a change in direction or changes in both. Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive, negative or zero. Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 3.9 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration; downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. As an exercise, identify in Fig. 3.3, the regions of the curve that correspond to these three cases. Although acceleration can vary with time, our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval.

(d) An object is moving in positive direction till time t1, and then turns back with the same negative acceleration, for example the motion of a car from point 0 to point Q in Fig. 3.1 till time t1 with decreasing speed and turning back and moving with the same negative acceleration. An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that the area under the curve represents the displacement over a given time interval.

Occupational Structure In some countries, such as India, the major economic activities in addition to the size of the population in designating a settlement as urban are also taken as a criterion. Similarly, in Italy, a settlement is called urban, if more than 50 per cent of its economically productive population is engaged in non-agricultural pursuits. India has set this criterion at 75 per cent. Administration The administrative setup is a criterion for classifying a settlement as urban in some countries. For example, in India, a settlement of any size is classified as urban, if it has a municipality, Cantonment Board or Notified Area Council. Similarly, in Latin American countries, such as Brazil and Bolivia, any administrative centre is considered urban irrespective of its population size. Location Location of urban centres is examined with reference to their function. For example, the sitting requirements of a holiday resort are quite different from that of an industrial town, a military centre or a seaport. Strategic towns require sites offering natural defence; mining towns require the presence of economically valuable minerals; industrial towns generally need local energy supplies or raw materials; tourist centres require attractive scenery, or a marine beach, a spring with medicinal water or historical relics, ports require a harbour etc. Locations of the earliest urban settlements were based on the availability of water, building materials and fertile land. Today, while these considerations still remain valid, modern technology plays a significant role in locating urban settlements far away from the source of these materials. Piped water can be supplied to a distant settlement, building material can be transported from long distances. Apart from site, the situation plays an ‘\ important role in the expansion of towns. The 2019—20 urban centres which are located close to an important trade route have experienced rapid development. Functions of Urban Centres The earliest towns were centres of administration, trade, industry, defence and religious importance. The significance of defence and religion as differentiating functions has declined in general, but other functions have entered the list. Today, several new functions, such as, recreational, residential, transport, mining, manufacturing and most recently activities related to information technology are carried on in specialised towns. Some of these functions do not necessarily require the urban centre to have any fundamental relationship with their neighbouring rural areas. f . What would be the effects of Information _/ and Communication Technology (ICT) as J a function on the development of existing and new settlements? § .Plctivitu Prepare a list of cities where earlier functions have been replaced by newer ones.

For example, we think of Sheffield as an industrial city, London as a port city, Chandigarh as an administrative city and so on. Large cities have a rather greater diversity of functions. Besides, all cities are dynamic and over a period of time may develop new functions. Most of the early nineteenth-century fishing ports in England have now developed tourism.

86,1740,"Accounting for Share Capital 3 5 1.7 Forfeiture of Shares It may happen that some shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments, viz. allotment money and / or call money. In such circumstances, the company can forfeit their shares, i.e. cancel their allotment and treat the amount already received thereon as forfeited to the company within the framework of the provisions in its articles. These provisions are usually based on Table F which authorise the directors to forefeit the shares for non—payment of calls made. For this purpose, they have to strictly follow the procedure laid down in this regard. Following is the accounting treatment of shares issued at par, premium or at a discount. When shares are forefeited all entries relating to the shares forfeited except those relating to premium, already recorded in the accounting records must be reversed. Accordingly, share capital account is debited with the amount called-up in respect of shares are forfeited and crediting the respective unpaid calls accounts’s or calls in arrears account with the amount already received. Thus, the journal entry will be as follows: (a) Forfeiture of Shares issued at Par: Share Capital A/c .......... (Called up amount) Dr. To Share Forfeiture A/c ........... (Paid up amount) To Share Allotment A/c To Share Calls A/c (individually) ( ..... shares forfeited for non-payment of allotment money and calls made) It may be noted here that when the shares are forfeited. all entries relating to the forfeited shares must be reversed except the entry relating to share premium received. if any. Accordingly, the share capital is debited to the extent to called-up capital and credited to (i) respective unpaid calls account i.e., calls in arrears and (ii) share forfeiture account with the amount already received on shares. The balance of shares forfeited account is shown as an addition to the total paid-up capital of the company under the head ‘Share Capital’ under title ‘Equity and Liabilities’ of the Balance Sheet till the forfeited shares are reissued.

Some SI derived units are given special names (AppendixA 6.2) and some derived SI units make use of these units with special names and the seven base units (Appendix A 6.3).

For example, a metre scale is used for lengths from 10’3m to 102 m. A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an accuracy of 10‘4 m. A screw gauge and a spherometer can be used to measure lengths as less as to l O’5m. To measure lengths beyond these ranges, we make use of some special indirect methods. 2019-20 5‘ F3 930‘an 5‘ SD h d X L t C 60 min = 3600 s 24 h = 86400 s 365.25 d = 3.156 x 107 5 1° = (11/ 180) rad I dma = 10“3 m3 103 kg 200 mg 0.1 MPa = 105Pa 3.7 x 10‘0 s“ 2.58 x 10“ C/kg 100 kg 100 fm2= 10‘28 m2 1 dam“ = 10‘ m2 1 hm2 = 104 m2 101325 Pa = 1.013 x 105 Pa 2.3.1 Measurement of Large Distances Large distances such as the distance of a planet or a star from the earth cannot be measured directly with a metre scale. An important method in such cases is the parallax method. When you hold a pencil in front of you against some specific point on the background (a wall) and look at the pencil first through your left eye A (closing the right eye) and then look at the pencil through your right eye B (closing the left eye), you would notice that the position of the pencil seems to change with respect to the point on the wall. This is called parallax. The distance between the two points of observation is called the basis. In this example, the basis is the distance between the eyes. To measure the distance D of a far away planet S by the parallax method, we observe it from two different positions (observatories) A and B on the Earth, separated by distance AB = b at the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2. We measure the angle between the two directions along which the planet is viewed at these two points. The AASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by symbol 0 is called the parallax angle or parallactic angle. As the planet is very far away, 5 << 1, and therefore, 0 is very small. Then we approximately take AB as an arc of length b of a circle with centre at S and the distance D as",0

91,403,"144 PHYSICS axis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating (sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about the vertical through the point at which the axis is pivoted (point 0 in Fig. 7 .5(b)). While the fan rotates and its axis moves sidewise, this point is fixed. Thus, in more general cases of rotation, such as the rotation of a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not one line, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case the axis is not fixed, though it always passes through the fixed point. In our study, however, we mostly deal with the simpler and special case of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is ﬁxed. Fig. 7.6(a) Motion of a rigid body which is pure translation. Fig. 7.6(b) Motion of a rigid body which is a combination of translation and rotation. Fig 7.6 (a) and 7.6 (b) illustrate different motions of the same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the body; 0 is the centre of mass of the body, which is deﬁned in the next section. Sufﬁce to say here that the trajectories of O are the translational trajectories Trl and Tr2 of the body. The positions 0 and P at three different instants of time are shown by 01, 02, and 03, and P1, P2 and P3, respectively, in both Figs. 7.6 (a) and (b) . As seenfrom Fig. 7.6(a), at any instant the velocities of any particles like 0 and P of the body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in this case the orientation of OP, i. e. the angle OP makes with a fixed direction, say the horizontal, remains the same, i.e. a1 = a2 = a3. Fig. 7.6 (b) illustrates a case of combination of translation and rotation. In this case, at any instants the velocities of O and P differ. Also, (11, a2 and as may all be different. 2019-20 Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis only unless stated otherwise. The rolling motion of a cylinder down an inclined plane is a combination of rotation about a fixed axis and translation. Thus, the ‘something else’ in the case of rolling motion which we referred to earlier is rotational motion. You will find Fig. 7 .6(a) and (b) instructive from this point of view. Both these figures show motion of the same body along identical translational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 7 .6(a), the motion is a pure translation; in the other case [Fig. 7.6(b)] it is a combination of translation and rotation. (You may try to reproduce the two types of motion shown, using a rigid object like a heavy book.) We now recapitulate the most important observations of the present section: The motion of a rigid body which is not pivoted or ﬁxed in some way is either a pure translation or a combination of translation and rotation. The motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or ﬁxed in some way is rotation. The rotation may be about an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or moving (e. g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.7 .5(b)]). We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only. 7.2 CENTRE OF MASS We shall first see what the centre of mass of a system of particles is and then discuss its significance. For simplicity we shall start with a two particle system. We shall take the line joining the two particles to be the x— axis.

94,668,"108 i Physics Consider two resistors R1 and R2 in series. The charge which leaves R1 must be entering R2. Since current measures the rate of ﬂow of charge, this means that the same current I ﬂows through R1 and R2. By Ohm’s law: Potential difference across R1 = V1 = I R1, and Potential difference across R2 = V2 = I R2. The potential difference Vacross the combination is V1+V2. Hence, V= V1+ V2 = 1(R1 + R2) (3.36) This is as if the combination had an equivalent resistance Reg, which by Ohm’s law is Req a; = (R1 + R2) (3.37) If we had three resistors connected in series, then similarly V=IR1 +IR2+IR3=I(R1+ R2+ R3). (3.38) This obviously can be extended to a series combination of any number n of resistors R1, R2 ..... , Rn. The equivalent resistance Req is Req=R1+R2+...+R11 (3.39) Consider now the parallel combination of two resistors (Fig. 3.15). The charge that ﬂows in at A from the left ﬂows out partly through R1 and partly through R2. The currents I, 11, I2 shown in the figure are the rates of ﬂow of charge at the points indicated. Hence, I: 11 + 12 (3.40) The potential difference between A and B is given by the Ohm’s law applied to R1 V: 11 R1 (3.41) Also, Ohm’s law applied to R2 gives V: I2 R2 (3.42) I — 11 + I2 — R1 R2 R1 R2 (3.43) If the combination was replaced by an equivalent resistance Req, we would have, by Ohm’s law PL —Req (3.44) Hence, ;_i+i Reg R1 R2 (3.45) We can easily see how this extends to three resistors in parallel (Fig. 3.16).

95,956,"SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS pollen tube. Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and style and reaches the ovary (Figure 2.12b, c). You would recall that in some plants, pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative cell and a generative cell). In such plants, the generative cell divides and forms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma. In plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes carry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching the ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of the synergids through the ﬁliform apparatus (Figure 2. 12d, e). Many recent studies have shown that ﬁliform apparatus present at the micropylar part of the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube. All these events—from pollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule—are together referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier, pollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition followed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained in this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil interaction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids. You can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from ﬂowers such as pea, chickpea, Crotalaria, balsam and Vinca on a glass slide containing a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15—30 minutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope. You are likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains. As you shall learn in the chapter on plant breeding (Chapter 9), a breeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera to combine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’ varieties. Artificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop improvement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important to make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination and the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen). This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques. If the female parent bears bisexual ﬂowers, removal of anthers from the ﬂower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is necessary. This step is referred to as emasculation. Emasculated ﬂowers have to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This process is called bagging. When the stigma of bagged ﬂower attains receptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent are dusted on the stigma, and the ﬂowers are rebagged, and the fruits allowed to develop. If the female parent produces unisexual ﬂowers, there is no need for emasculation. The female ﬂower buds are bagged before the ﬂowers open. When the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the desired pollen and the ﬂower rebagged. 2019-2020",1

The unit of force has not been defined so far. In fact, we use Eq. (5.4) to deﬁne the unit of force. We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any constant value for k. For simplicity, we choose k = 1. The second law then is dp_ F: E — ma (5.5) In SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration of 1 m s2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as newton: 1 N = 1 kgm s2. Let us note at this stage some important points about the second law : 1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = O. The second law is obviously consistent with the first law. 2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is equivalent to three equations, one for each component of the vectors : dp FX 2 dtx = max dpy Fy = — 2 may dt dp Fz= dtz=m a2 (5.6) This means that if a force is not parallel to the velocity of the body, but makes some angle with it, it changes only the component of velocity along the direction of force. The component of velocity normal to the force remains unchanged. For example, in the motion of a projectile under the vertical gravitational force, the horizontal component of velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5). 3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is applicable to a single point particle. The force F in the law stands for the net external force on the particle and a stands for acceleration of the particle. It turns out, however, that the law in the same form applies to a rigid body or, even more generally, to a system of particles. In that case, F refers to the total external force on the system and a refers to the acceleration of the system as a whole. More precisely, a is the acceleration of the centre of mass of the system about which we shall study in detail in chapter 7. Any internal forces in the system are not to be included in F. Fig. 5.5 Acceleration at an instant is detem1ined by the force at that instant. The moment after a stone is dropped out of an accelerated train, it has no horizontal acceleration or force, if air resistance is neglected. The stone carries no memory of its acceleration with the train a moment ago. 4. The second law of motion is a local relation which means that force F at a point in space (location of the particle) at a certain instant of time is related to a at that point at that instant. Acceleration here and now is determined by the force here and now, not by any history of the motion of the particle (See Fig. 5.5). > Example 5.2 A bullet of mass 0.04 kg moving with a speed of 90 m s'1 enters a heavy wooden block and is stopped after a distance of 60 cm.

We have already seen that the sound waves travel in the form of compressions and rarefactions of small volume elements of air. The elastic property that determines the stress under compressional strain is the bulk modulus of the medium deﬁned by (see Chapter 9) AP B = — AV/V (15.16) Here, the change in pressure AP produces a AV volumetric strain 7 . B has the same dimension as pressure and given in SI units in terms of pascal (Pa). The inertial property relevant for the propagation of wave is the mass density p, with dimensions [ML—3]. Simple inspection reveals that quantity B/ p has the relevant dimension: [M L‘1 T'2] [M L’s] Thus, if B and p are considered to be the only relevant physical quantities, =[L2 T'2] (15.17) v =0 5 (15.18) p where, as before, C is the undetermined constant from dimensional analysis. The exact derivation shows that C=1. Thus, the general formula for longitudinal waves in a medium is: v = — (15.19) For a linear medium, like a solid bar, the lateral expansion of the bar is negligible and we may consider it to be only under longitudinal strain. In that case, the relevant modulus of elasticity is Young’s modulus, which has the same dimension as the Bulk modulus. Dimensional analysis for this case is the same as before and yields a relation like Eq. (15.18). with an undetermined C, which the exact derivation shows to be unity. Thus, the speed of longitudinal waves in a solid bar is given by v = X (15.20) p where Y is the Young’s modulus of the material of the bar. Table 15.1 gives the speed of sound in some media.

The acceleration is directed, at each point of the path, towards the centre of the circle. Let r and r’ be the position vectors and v and v’ the velocities of the object when it is at point P and P’ as shown in Fig. 4.19(a). By definition, velocity at a point is along the tangent at that point in the direction of motion. The velocity vectors v and v’ are as shown in Fig. 4.19(a1). Av is obtained in Fig. 4. 19 (a2) using the triangle law of vector addition. Since the path is circular, v is perpendicular to r and so is v’ to r’. Therefore, Av is perpendicular to Ar. Since A I average acceleration is along Av L5 : —VJ, the At average acceleration E is perpendicular to Ar.

Then the incoming oc-particle could get very close to the positive charge without penetrating it, and such a close encounter would result in a large deﬂection. This agreement supported the hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This is why Rutherford is credited with the discovery of the nucleus. In Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom, the entire positive charge and most of the mass of the atom are concentrated in the nucleus with the electrons some distance away. The electrons would be moving in orbits about the nucleus just as the planets FIGURE 12.3 Experimental data points (shown by do around the sun.

Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a distance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of the nucleus itself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom being largely empty space, it is easy to see why most oc-particles go right through a thin metal foil. However, when oc-particle happens to come near a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large angle. The atomic electrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the oc-particles. The scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analysed by employing Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom. As the gold foil is very thin, it can be assumed that oc-particles will suffer not more than one scattering during their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory of an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha- particles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2e, of positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of the gold nucleus is Ze, where Z is the atomic number of the atom; for gold Z = 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an oc-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary throughout the scattering process. Under these assumptions, the trajectory of an alpha-particle can be computed employing Newton’s second law of motion and the Coulomb’s law for electrostatic force of repulsion between the alpha-particle and the positively charged nucleus. 4 1 7 2019-20",0

The most important ones are temperature, water, light and soil. We must remember that the physico-chemical (abiotic) components alone do not characterise the habitat of an organism completely; the habitat includes biotic components also — pathogens, parasites, predators and competitors — of the organism with which they interact constantly. We assume that over a period of time, the organism had through natural selection, evolved adaptations to optimise its survival and reproduction in its habitat. Each organism has an invariably deﬁned range of conditions that it can tolerate, diversity in the resources it utilises and a distinct functional role in the ecological system, all these together comprise its niche. 13. 1. 1 Major Abiotic Factors Temperature: Temperature is the most important ecologically relevant environmental factor. You are aware that the average temperature on land varies seasonally, decreases progressively from the equator towards the poles and from plains to the mountain tops. It ranges from subzero levels in polar areas and high altitudes to >50°C in tropical deserts in summer. There are, however, unique habitats such as thermal springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents where average temperatures exceed 1000 C.

108,528,"8.1 Electromagnetic Woves names; y-rays. X—rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays. infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves in order of increasing wavelength from 10‘2 A or 10'12m to 106m. They interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields which set in oscillation charges present in all matter. The detailed interaction and so the mechanism of absorption, scattering. etc.. depend on the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and molecules in the medium. POINTS TO PONDER 1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves lies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through vacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ considerably in their mode of interaction with matter. 2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the characteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus. gamma radiation. having wavelength of 10'14 m to 10'15 m, typically originate from an atomic nucleus. X—rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves are produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting antenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of about the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms is, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size. 3. The oscillating fields of an electromagnetic wave can accelerate charges and can produce oscillating currents. Therefore, an apparatus designed to detect electromagnetic waves is based on this fact. Hertz original ‘receiver’ worked in exactly this way. The same basic principle is utilised in practically all modern receiving devices. High frequency electromagnetic waves are detected by other means based on the physical effects they produce on interacting with matter. 4. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light. Vibrate not only the electrons. but entire atoms or molecules of a substance. This vibration increases the internal energy and consequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared waves are often called heat waves. 5. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the wavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved with visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from the sun. Figure 8.6 shows a capacitor made of two circular plates each of radius 12 cm, and separated by 5.0 cm. The capacitor is being charged by an external source (not shown in the figure).

109,981,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS examples of imbibition are absorption of water by seeds and dry wood. The pressure that is produced by the swelling of wood had been used by prehistoric man to split rocks and boulders. If it were not for the pressure due to imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of the soil into the open; they probably would not have been able to establish! Imbibition is also diffusion since water movement is along a concentration gradient; the seeds and other such materials have almost no water hence they absorb water easily. Water potential gradient between the absorbent and the liquid imbibed is essential for imbibition. In addition, for any substance to imbibe any liquid, afﬁnity between the adsorbant and the liquid is also a pre-requisite. 1 1.3 LONG DISTANCE TRANSPORT OF WATER At some earlier stage you might have carried out an experiment where you had placed a twig bearing white ﬂowers in coloured water and had watched it turn colour. On examining the cut end of the twig after a few hours you had noted the region through which the coloured water moved. ’Ihat experiment very easily demonstrates that the path of water movement is through the vascular bundles, more speciﬁcally, the xylem. Now we have to go further and try and understand the mechanism of movement of water and other substances up a plant. Long distance transport of substances within a plant cannot be by diffusion alone. Diffusion is a slow process. It can account for only short distance movement of molecules. For example, the movement of a molecule across a typical plant cell (about 50 um) takes approximately 2.5 s. At this rate, can you calculate how many years it would take for the movement of molecules over a distance of 1 m within a plant by diffusion alone? In large and complex organisms, often substances have to be moved to long distances. Sometimes the sites of production or absorption and sites of storage are too far from each other; diffusion or active transport would not sufﬁce. Special long distance transport systems become necessary so as to move substances across long distances and at a much faster rate. Water and minerals, and food are generally moved by a mass or bulk ﬂow system. Mass ﬂow is the movement of substances in bulk or en masse from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. It is a characteristic of mass ﬂow that substances, whether in solution or in suspension, are swept along at the same pace, as in a ﬂowing river. This is unlike diffusion where different substances move independently depending on their concentration gradients. Bulk ﬂow can be achieved either through a positive hydrostatic pressure gradient (e. g., a garden hose) or a negative hydrostatic pressure gradient (e. g., suction through a straw). 183",1

The magnitude of this force works out to be as stated above. Newton's Principia Kepler had formulated his third law by 1619. The announcement of the underlying universal law of gravitation came about seventy years later with the publication in 1687 of Newton‘s masterpiece Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematics, often simply called the Principia. Around 1685, Edmund Halley [after whom the famous Halley's comet is named). came to visit Newton at Cambridge and asked him about the nature of the trajectory of a body moving under the inﬂuence of an inverse square law. Without hesitation Newton replied that it had to be an ellipse. and further that he had worked it out long ago around 1665 when he was forced to retire to his farm house from Cambridge on account of a plague outbreak. Unfortunately. Newton had lost his papers. Halley prevailed upon Newton to produce his work in book form and agreed to bear the cost of publication. Newton accomplished this feat in eighteen months of superhuman effort. The Principia is a singular scientiﬁc masterpiece and in the words of Lagrange it is “the greatest production of the human mind.“ The Indian born astrophysicist and Nobel laureate S. Chandrasekhar spent ten years writing a treatise on the Principia. His book. Newton's Principia for the Common Reader brings into sharp focus the beauty. clarity and breath taking economy of Newton‘s methods. 2019-20",0

113,973,"SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS endosperm tissue. The cells of this tissue are filled with reserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of the developing embryo. In the most common type of endosperm development, the PEN undergoes successive nuclear divisions to give rise to free nuclei. This stage of endosperm development is called free-nuclear endosperm. Subsequently cell wall formation occurs and the endosperm becomes cellular. The number of free nuclei formed before cellularisation varies greatly. The coconut water from tender coconut that you are familiar with, is nothing but free-nuclear endosperm (made up of thousands of nuclei) and the surrounding white kernel is the cellular endosperm. Endosperm may either be completely consumed by the (a) developing embryo (e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) before seed maturation or it may persist in the mature seed (e.g. castor and coconut) and be used up during seed germination. Split open some seeds of castor, peas, beans, groundnut, fruit of coconut and look for the endosperm in each case. Find out whether the endosperm is persistent in cereals — wheat, rice and maize. Scutellum :— 7 Coleoptile 2.4.2 Embryo Shoot apex Embryo develops at the micropylar end of the embryo sac where the zygote is situated. Most zygotes divide only after certain amount of endosperm is formed. This is an adaptation to provide assured nutrition to the developing embryo. Though the seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development (embryogeny) are similar in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Figure 2.13 depicts the stages of embryogeny in a dicotyledonous embryo. The zygote gives rise to the proembryo and subsequently to the globular, heart-shaped and mature embryo. A typical dicotyledonous embryo (Figure 2.14a), consists Epiblast (b) of an embryonal axis and two cotyledons.

In basal placentation, the placenta develops at the base of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in sunﬂower, marigold. 5.6 THE FRUIT The fruit is a characteristic feature of the ﬂowering plants. It is a mature or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit. Generally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The pericarp may be dry or ﬂeshy. When pericarp is thick and ﬂeshy, it is differentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner endocarp. Epicarp Mesocarp Seed Endocarp- (b) Figure 5.17 Parts of a fruit : (a) Mango (b) Coconut In mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure 5.17). They develop from monocarpellary superior ovaries and are one seeded. In mango the pericarp is well differentiated into an outer thin epicarp, a middle ﬂeshy edible mesocarp and an inner stony hard endocarp. In coconut which is also a drupe, the mesocarp is ﬁbrous. 5.7 THE SEED The ovules after fertilisation, develop into seeds. A seed is made up of a seed coat and an embryo. The embryo is made up of a radicle, an embryonal axis and one (as in wheat, maize) or two cotyledons (as in gram and pea). 5.7. 1 Structure of a Dicotyledonous Seed The outermost covering of a seed is the seed coat. The seed coat has two layers, the outer testa and the inner tegmen. The hilum is a scar on the seed coat through which the developing seeds were attached to the fruit. Above the hilum is a small pore called the micropyle. Within the seed",1

(iv) The magnetic ﬁeld lines do not intersect, for if they did, the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld would not be unique at the point of intersection. One can plot the magnetic field lines in a variety of ways. One way is to place a small magnetic compass needle at various positions and note its orientation. This gives us an idea of the magnetic ﬁeld direction at various points in space. 5.2.2 Bar magnet as an equivalent solenoid In the previous chapter, we have explained how a current loop acts as a magnetic dipole (Section 4.10). We mentioned Ampere’s hypothesis that all magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of circulating currents. FIGURE 5.4 Calculation of (a) The axial field of a finite solenoid in order to demonstrate its similarity to that of a bar magnet. (b) A magnetic needle in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B. The arrangement may be used to determine either B or the magnetic moment In of the needle. Recall that the magnetic dipole moment m associated with a current loop was deﬁned to be m = N1 A where N is the number of turns in the loop, I the current and A the area vector (Eq. 4.30). The resemblance of magnetic ﬁeld lines for a bar magnet and a solenoid suggest that a bar magnet may be thought of as a large number of circulating currents in analogy with a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet in half is like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller solenoids with weaker magnetic properties. The ﬁeld lines remain continuous, emerging from one face of the solenoid and entering into the other face. One can test this analogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of a bar magnet and a current-carrying ﬁnite solenoid and noting that the deﬂections of the needle are similar in both cases. To make this analogy more firm we calculate the axial ﬁeld of a ﬁnite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.4 (a). We shall demonstrate that at large distances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet. Let the solenoid of Fig. 5.4(a) consists of n turns per unit length. Let its length be 21 and radius a. We can evaluate the axial ﬁeld at a point P, at a distance r from the centre 0 of the solenoid. To do this, consider a circular element of thickness dxof the solenoid at a distance xfrom its centre. It consists of n dxturns. Let I be the current in the solenoid. In Section 4.6 of the previous chapter we have calculated the magnetic ﬁeld on the axis of a circular current loop. From Eq.

It usually applies to the two important financial statements, namely, balance sheet and statement of proﬁt and loss prepared in a comparative form. The financial data will be comparative only when same accounting principles are used in preparing these statements. If this is not the case, the deviation in the use of accounting principles should be mentioned as a footnote.

The percentage thus calculated can be easily compared with the results of corresponding percentages of the previous year or of some other ﬁrms, as the numbers are brought to common base. Such statements also allow an analyst to compare the operating and ﬁnancing characteristics of two companies of different sizes in the same industry.

One of the male gametes moves towards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the syngamy. This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The other male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central cell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN) Wigure 2.13a). As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it is termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple fusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double fertilisation, an event unique to ﬂowering plants.

119,716,"Electromagnetic Induction or current in a loop is through a change in the loops orientation or a change in its effective area. As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the effective area of the loop (the face perpendicular to the field) is A cos 0, where 9 is the angle between A and B. This method of producing a ﬂux change is the principle of operation of a simple ac generator. An ac generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6. 16. It consists of a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil Slip is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic rings< field. The coil (called armature) is mechanically rotated in the uniform magnetic field by some external means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic ﬂux through it to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the coil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings and brushes. When the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed a), the angle 0 between the magnetic field vector B and the area vectorA of the coil at any instant tis 9 = wt (assuming 0 = 0° at t= 0). As a result, the effective area of the coil exposed to the magnetic ﬁeld lines changes with time, and from Eq. (6.1), the ﬂux at any time tis (PB = BA cos 0 = BA cos wt From Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N turns is then, Coil Alternating emf Carbon brushes FIGURE 6.16 AC Generator d 953 dt Thus, the instantaneous value of the emf is 8=NBAwsinaJt (6.21) where NBAa) is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when sin wtzil.

Note from Fig. 6.17 that the emf has its extremum value when 0 = 90° or 0 = 270°, as the change of ﬂux is greatest at these points. The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current is called alternating current (ac). Since a)= 27W, Eq (6.22) can be written as 8 = 80sin 27c vt (6.23) where v is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil. Note that Eq. (6.22) and (6.23) give the instantaneous value of the emf and 8 varies between +80 and —80 periodically.

In regions of pronounced monsoonal ﬂow, the monsoon winds influence the current movements. Due to the coriolis force, the warm currents from low latitudes tend to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to their left in the southern hemisphere. The oceanic circulation transports heat from one latitude belt to another in a manner similar to the heat transported by the general circulation of the atmosphere. The cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic circles move towards warmer water in tropical and equatorial regions, while the warm waters of the lower latitudes move polewards. The major currents in the different oceans are shown in Figure14.3. Prepare a list of currents which are found in Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. How is the movement of currents inﬂuenced by prevailing winds? Give some examples from Figure 14.3. Effects of Ocean Currents Ocean currents have a number of direct and indirect inﬂuences on human activities. West coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes (except close to the equator) are bordered by cool waters. Their average temperatures are relatively low with a narrow diurnal and annual ranges. There is fog, but generally the areas are arid. West coasts of the continents in the middle and higher latitudes are bordered by warm waters which cause a distinct marine climate. They are characterised by cool summers and relatively mild winters with a narrow annual range of temperatures. Warm currents ﬂow parallel to the east coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This results in warm and rainy climates. These areas lie in the western margins of the subtropical anti-cyclones. The mixing of warm and cold currents help to replenish the oxygen and favour the growth of planktons, the primary food for fish population. The best fishing grounds of the world exist mainly in these mixing zones. 2019-2020",2

The knowledge of areas which are working better helps you improve the situation further. It must be emphasised that ratios are means to an end rather than the end in themselves. Their role is essentially indicative and that of a whistle blower. There are many advantages derived from ratio analysis. These are summarised as follows: 1. Helps to understand efﬁcacy of decisions: The ratio analysis helps you to understand whether the business ﬁrm has taken the right kind of operating, investing and ﬁnancing decisions. It indicates how far they have helped in improving the performance. Simplify complex figures and establish relationships: Ratios help in simplifying the complex accounting figures and bring out their relationships. They help summarise the ﬁnancial information effectively and assess the managerial efﬁciency, ﬁrm's credit worthiness, earning capacity, etc. Helpful in comparative analysis: The ratios are not be calculated for one year only. When many year ﬁgures are kept side by side, they help a great deal in exploring the trends visible in the business. The knowledge of trend helps in making projections about the business which is a very useful feature. Identiﬁcation of problem areas: Ratios help business in identifying the problem areas as well as the bright areas of the business. Problem areas would need more attention and bright areas will need polishing to have still better results. Enables SWOT analysis: Ratios help a great deal in explaining the changes occurring in the business. The information of change helps the management a great deal in understanding the current threats and opportunities and allows business to do its own SWOT (Strength- Weakness-Opportunity—Threat) analysis. Various comparisons: Ratios help comparisons with certain bench marks to assess as to whether ﬁrm's performance is better or otherwise. For this purpose, the proﬁtability, liquidity, solvency, etc., of a business, may be compared: (i) over a number of accounting periods with itself (Intra—ﬁrm Comparison /Time Series Analysis), (ii) with other business enterprises (Inter-ﬁrm Comparison/Cross-sectional Analysis) and (iii) with standards set for that ﬁrm / indusz (comparison with standard (or industry expectations). 5.4 Limitations of Ratio Analysis Since the ratios are derived from",3

You can get this kind of a membrane in an egg. Remove the yolk and albumin through a small hole at one end of the egg, and place the shell in dilute solution of hydrochloric acid for a few hours. The egg shell dissolves leaving the membrane intact. Water will move into the funnel, resulting in rise in the level of the solution in the funnel. This will continue till the equilibrium is reached. In case sucrose does diffuse out through the membrane, will this equilibrium be ever reached? External pressure can be applied from the upper part of the funnel such that no water diffuses into the funnel through the membrane. This pressure required to prevent water from diffusing is in fact, the osmotic pressure and this is the function of the solute concentration; more the solute concentration, greater will be the pressure required to prevent water from diffusing in. Numerically osmotic pressure is equivalent to the osmotic potential, but the sign is opposite.Osmotic pressure is the positive pressure applied, while osmotic potential is negative. 1 1 .2 .3 Plasmolysis The behaviour of the plant cells (or tissues) with regard to water movement depends on the surrounding solution. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm, it is said to be isotonic. If the external solution is more dilute than the cytoplasm, it is hypotonic and if the external solution is more concentrated, it is hypertonic.

This motion of suspension can be observed. Figure 5.12(b) shows the situation when the domains have aligned and amalgamated to form a single ‘giant’ domain. Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly concentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move towards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens when the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the magnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materials or hard ferromagnets. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt and copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is another. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other things as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class of ferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal of the external ﬁeld. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough, such materials are called soﬁ ferromagnetic materials. There are a number of elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, etc. The relative magnetic permeability is > 1000! The ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough temperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The domain structure disintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation with temperature is gradual. It is a phase transition reminding us of the melting of a solid crystal. The temperature of transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetism is called the Curie temperature TC. Table 5.4 lists the Curie temperature of certain ferromagnets.

131,467,"l92 PHYSICS If we associate a potential energy W(h) at a point at a height h above the surface such that W(h) = mgh + W0 (8.21) (where WO = constant) ; then it is clear that W12 = W(h) — W(hl) (8.22) The work done in moving the particle is just the difference of potential energy between its final and initial positions.Observe that the constant W0 cancels out in Eq. (8.22). Setting h = O in the last equation, we get W( h = O ) = W0. . h = 0 means points on the surface of the earth. Thus, W0 is the potential energy on the surface of the earth. If we consider points at arbitrary distance from the surface of the earth, the result just derived is not valid since the assumption that the gravitational force mg is a constant is no longer valid. However, from our discussion we know that a point outside the earth, the force of gravitation on a particle directed towards the centre of the earth is GM E m F= r2 (8.23) where ME = mass of earth, m = mass of the particle and r its distance from the centre of the earth. If we now calculate the work done in lifting a particle from r= r1 to r = r2 (r2 > r1) along a vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (8.20) GMm W12 2}: r2 dr 1 1 =-GME m [—-—J (8.24) r2 ’1 In place of Eq. (8.2 1), we can thus associate a potential energy W(r) at a distance r, such that G ME m r valid for r > R , so that once again W12 = W(r2) — W(rl). Setting r = infinity in the last equation, we get W ( r = infinity ) = W1. Thus, W1 is the potential energy at infinity. One should note that only the difference of potential energy between two points has a definite meaning from Eqs. (8.22) and (8.24). One conventionally sets W1 equal to zero, so that the potential energy at a point is just the amount of work done in displacing the particle from infinity to that point. W(r) =— +VVI, (8.25) 2019-20 We have calculated the potential energy at a point of a particle due to gravitational forces on it due to the earth and it is proportional to the mass of the particle. The gravitational potential due to the gravitational force of the earth is defined as the potential energy of a particle of unit mass at that point. From the earlier discussion, we learn that the gravitational potential energy associated with two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by distance by a distance r is given by Gmlm2 r It should be noted that an isolated system of particles will have the total potential energy that equals the sum of energies (given by the above equation) for all possible pairs of its constituent particles.

132,815,"132 BIOLOGY An improved model of the structure of cell membrane was proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as ﬂuid mosaic model (Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-ﬂuid nature of lipid enables lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move within the membrane is measured as its ﬂuidity. The ﬂuid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc. One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move brieﬂy across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this is called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of water by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions or molecules are transported across the membrane against their concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and is called active transport, e. g., Na+/K+ Pump. 8.5.2 CellWall As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins. The cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth, which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell. The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds or glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells. 8.5.3 Endomembrane System While each of the membranous organelles is distinct in terms of its",1

Further, the electric ﬁeld due to the comb is not uniform. In this situation, it is easily seen that the paper should move in the direction of the comb! 1. 13 CONTINUOUS CHARGE DISTRIBUTION We have so far dealt with charge conﬁgurations involving discrete charges q1, q2, qn. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For many purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms Of discrete charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For example, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify the charge distribution in terms Of the locations of the microscopic charged constituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element AS (Fig. 1.24) on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic scale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and specify the charge AQ on that element. We then deﬁne a surface charge density a at the area element by AQ 0':— AS We can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at a continuous function 6, called the surface charge density. The surface charge density (7 so deﬁned ignores the quantisation of charge and the discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. 6 represents macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out average of the microscopic charge density over an area element AS which, as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The units for a are C / m2. Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume charge distribution. The linear charge density 1 of a wire is deﬁned by AQ ,1 _ Al (1.24) where Al is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that, however, includes a large number Of microscopic charged constituents, and AQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for A are C / m. The volume charge density (sometimes simply called charge density) is defined in a similar manner: AQ “E where AQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume element AV that includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents. The units for p are C / m3. The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we adopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to (1.23) (1.25) * At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are discrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge. 2019-20",0
134,850,"BIOLOGY predator or the effect of a pesticide application, we always evaluate them in terms of any change in the population size. The size, in nature, could be as low as < 10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or go into millions (Chlamydomonas in a pond). Population size, technically called population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be measured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most appropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either meaningless or difficult to determine. In an area, if there are 200 carrot grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants but only a single huge banyan tree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is low relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the enormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population size. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming. If you have a dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish what is the best measure to report its density? Sometimes, for certain ecological investigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities; relative densities serve the purpose equally well. For instance, the number of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population density in the lake. We are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes indirectly, without actually counting them or seeing them. The tiger census in our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and fecal pellets. 13.2.2 Population Growth The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter. It keeps changing with time, depending on various factors including food availability, predation pressure and adverse weather. In fact, it is these changes in population density that give us some idea of what is happening to the population — whether it is ﬂourishing or declining. Whatever might be the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat during a given period, ﬂuctuates due to changes in four basic processes, two of which (natality and immigration) contribute to an increase in population density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease. (i) Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density. (ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period. (iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration. (iv) Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under consideration. 2019-2020",1

Among animals, insects are the most species-rich taxonomic group, making up more than 70 per cent of the total. That means, out of every 10 animals on this planet, 7 are insects.

Biologists are not sure about how many prokaryotic species there might be. The problem is that conventional taxonomic methods are not suitable for identifying microbial species and many species are simply not culturable under laboratory conditions.

The plant tissues are broadly classiﬁed into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent (simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water, minerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of tissues. There are three types oftissue Systems — epidermal, ground and vascular. The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the plant. It is divided into three Zones — cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular tissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of cambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different types. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water, minerals and food material.",1

139,1455,"Chapter-10 .EI' 12097CH10 Human Settlements We all live in clusters of houses. You may call it a village, a town or a city, all are examples of human settlements. The study of human settlements is basic to human geography because the form of settlement in any particular region reﬂects human relationship with the environment. A human settlement is deﬁned as a place inhabited more or less permanently. The houses may be designed or redesigned, buildings may be altered, functions may change but settlement continues in time and space. There may be some settlements which are temporary and are occupied for short periods, may be a season. CLASSIFICATION OF SETTLEMENTS RURAL URBAN DICHOTOMY It is widely accepted that settlements can be differentiated in terms of rural and urban, but there is no consensus on what exactly defines a village or a town. Although population size is an important criterion, it is not a universal criterion since many villages in densely populated countries of India and China have population exceeding that of some towns of Western Europe and United States. At one time, people living in villages pursued agriculture or other primary activities, but presently in developed countries, large sections of urban populations prefer to live in villages even though they work in the city. The basic difference between towns and villages is that in towns the main occupation of the people is related to secondary and tertiary sectors, while in the villages most of the people are engaged in primary occupations such as agriculture, fishing, lumbering, mining, animal husbandry, etc. Sub Urbanisatibn It is a new trend of people moving away from congested urban areas to cleaner areas outside the city in search of a better quality of living. Important suburbs develop around major cities and everyday thousands of people commute from their homes in the sub urbs to their work places in the city. 2019—20",2

Answer Increase in the tension of a string increases its frequency. If the original frequency of B (VB) were greater than that of A (VA), further increase in vB should have resulted in an increase in the beat frequency. But the beat frequency is found to decrease. This shows that vB < vA.

As a result the air following after it in the tube is pushed out. The low pressure at the end of the tube draws air from further up the tube. The air gets drawn towards the open end forcing the low pressure region to move upwards. As a result a pulse of high pressure air travelling down the tube turns into a pulse of low pressure air travelling up the tube. We say a pressure wave has been reﬂected at the open end with a change in phase of 180°. Standing waves in an open pipe organ like the ﬂute is a result of this phenomenon. Compare this with what happens when a pulse of high pressure air arrives at a closed end: it collides and as a result pushes the air back in the opposite direction. Here. we say that the pressure wave is reﬂected. with no change in phase. decreases as it recedes away. When we approach a stationary source of sound with high speed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to be higher than that of the source. As the observer recedes away from the source, the observed pitch (or frequency) becomes lower than that of the source. This motion-related frequency change is called Doppler effect. The Austrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler first proposed the effect in 1842. Buys Ballot in Holland tested it experimentally in 1845. Doppler effect is a wave phenomenon, it holds not only for sound waves but also for electromagnetic waves. However, here we shall consider only sound waves.

You know that living organisms of the earth, constituting the biosphere, interact with other environmental realms. The biosphere includes all the living components of the earth. It consists of all plants and animals, including all the micro- Life on the earth is found almost everywhere. Living organisms are found from the poles to the equator, from the bottom of the sea to several km in the air, from freezing waters to dry valleys, from under the sea to underground water lying below the earth’s surface. organisms that live on the planet earth and their interactions with the surrounding environment. Most of the organisms exist on the lithosphere and / or the hydrosphere as well as in the atmosphere. There are also many organisms that move freely from one realm to the other. The biosphere and its components are very significant elements of the environment. These elements interact with other components of the natural landscape such as land, water and soil. They are also influenced by the atmospheric elements such as the temperature, rainfall, moisture and sunlight. The interactions of biosphere with land, air and water are important to the growth, development and evolution of the organism. CHAPTER ECOLOGY You have been reading about ecological and environmental problems in newspapers and magazines. Have you ever thought what ecology is? The environment as you know, is made up of abiotic and biotic components. It would be interesting to understand how the diversity of life-forms is maintained to bring a kind of balance. This balance is maintained in a particular proportion so that a healthy interaction between the biotic and the abiotic components goes on. The interactions of a particular group of organisms with abiotic factors within a particular habitat resulting in clearly deﬁned energy ﬂows and material cycles on land, water and air, are called ecological systems. The term ecology is derived from the Greek word ‘oikos’ meaning ‘house’, combined with the word ‘logy’ meaning the ‘science of or ‘the study of’. Literally, ecology is the study of the earth as a ‘household’, of plants, human beings, animals and micro-organisms. They all live together as interdependent components. A German zoologist Ernst Haeckel, who used the term as ‘oekologie’ in 1869, became the first person to use the term ‘ecology’. The study of interactions between life forms (biotic) and the physical environment (abiotic) is the science of ecology. Hence, ecology can be defined as a scientific study of the interactions of organisms with their physical environment and with each other. 2019-2020",2
143,785,"186 BIOLOGY ﬁlaments form a network around the young root or they penetrate the root cells. The hyphae have a very large surface area that absorb mineral ions and water from the soil from a much larger volume of soil that perhaps a root cannot do. The fungus provides minerals and water to the roots, in turn the roots provide sugars and N-containing compounds to the mycorrhizae. Some plants have an obligate association with the mycorrhizae. For example, Pinus seeds cannot germinate and establish without the presence of mycorrhizae. 1 1.3.2 Water Movement up a Plant We looked at how plants absorb water from the soil, and move it into the vascular tissues. We now have to try and understand how this water is transported to various parts of the plant. Is the water movement active, or is it still passive? Since the water has to be moved up a stem against gravity, what provides the energy for this? 1 1 .3.2.1 Root Pressure As various ions from the soil are actively transported into the vascular tissues of the roots, water follows (its potential gradient) and increases the pressure inside the xylem. This positive pressure is called root pressure, and can be responsible for pushing up water to small heights in the stem. How can we see that root pressure exists? Choose a small soft-stemmed plant and on a day, when there is plenty of atmospheric moisture, cut the stem horizontally near the base with a sharp blade, early in the morning. You will soon see drops of solution ooze out of the cut stem; this comes out due to the positive root pressure. If you ﬁx a rubber tube to the cut stem as a sleeve you can actually collect and measure the rate of exudation, and also determine the composition of the exudates. Effects of root pressure is also observable at night and early morning when evaporation is low, and excess water collects in the form of droplets around special openings of veins near the tip of grass blades, and leaves of many herbaceous parts. Such water loss in its liquid phase is known as guttation. Root pressure can, at best, only provide a modest push in the overall process of water transport. They obviously do not play a major role in water movement up tall trees. The greatest contribution of root pressure may be to re-establish the continuous chains of water molecules in the xylem which often break under the enormous tensions created by transpiration. Root pressure does not account for the majority of water transport; most plants meet their need by transpiratory pull. 11.3.2.2 Transpiration pull Despite the absence of a heart or a circulatory system in plants, the upward ﬂow of water through the xylem in plants can achieve fairly high",1

Electromagnetic waves also transfer momentum to your hand but because 0 is very large, the amount of momentum transferred is extremely small and you do not feel the pressure. In 1903, the American scientists Nicols and Hull succeeded in measuring radiation pressure of visible light and verified Eq. (8.12). It was found to be of the order of 7 X 1043 N /m2. Thus, on a surface of area 10 cm2, the force due to radiation is only about 7 X 10‘9 N. The great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems from their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The radio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light carries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on the earth. Example 8.2 A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency 25 MHz travels in free space along the x—direction. At a particular point in space and time, E = 6.3 j V/m. What is B at this point? Solution Using Eq. (8.10), the magnitude of B is B:— c =w=2ixio$T 3x10 m/s To find the direction, we note that E is along y-direction and the wave propagates along x-axis. Therefore, B should be in a direction perpendicular to both x- and y—axes. Using vector algebra, E X B should be along x-direction. Since, (+3) X (+11) = i, B is along the z—direction. Thus, B = 2.1 x 10—8 kT Example 8.3 The magnetic field in a plane electromagnetic wave is given by By = (2 x 10”) T sin (0.5x103x+1.5x10“t). (a) What is the wavelength and frequency of the wave?

146,185,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 257 moves inside the master cylinder, and the pressure caused is transmitted through the brake oil to act on a piston of larger area. A large force acts on the piston and is pushed down expanding the brake shoes against brake lining. In this way, a small force on the pedal produces a large retarding force on the wheel. An important advantage of the system is that the pressure set up by pressing pedal is transmitted equally to all cylinders attached to the four wheels so that the braking effort is equal on all wheels. 10.3 STREAMLINE FLOW So far we have studied ﬂuids at rest. The study of the ﬂuids in motion is known as ﬂuid dynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly, the water ﬂow is smooth initially, but loses its smoothness when the speed of the outﬂow is increased. In studying the motion of ﬂuids, we focus our attention on what is happening to various ﬂuid particles at a particular point in space at a particular time. The ﬂow of the ﬂuid is said to be steady if at any given point, the velocity of each passing ﬂuid particle remains constant in time. This does not mean that the velocity at different points in space is same. The velocity of a particular particle may change as it moves from one point to another. That is, at some other point the particle may have a different velocity, but every other particle which passes the second point behaves exactly as the previous particle that has just passed that point. Each particle follows a smooth path, and the paths of the particles do not cross each other. Fig. 10.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical trajectory of a ﬂuid particle. (b) A region of streamline ﬂow. The path taken by a ﬂuid particle under a steady ﬂow is a streamline. It is defined as a curve whose tangent at any point is in the direction of the ﬂuid velocity at that point. Consider the path of a particle as shown in Fig.10.7 (a), the curve describes how a ﬂuid particle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a permanent map of ﬂuid ﬂow, indicating how the ﬂuid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for if they do, an oncoming ﬂuid particle can go either one way or the other and the ﬂow would not be steady. Hence, in steady ﬂow, the map of ﬂow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely spaced streamlines ? If we intend to show streamline of every ﬂowing particle, we would end up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes perpendicular to the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow e. g., at three points P, R and Q in Fig. 10.7 (b). The plane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries be determined by the same set of streamlines. This means that number of ﬂuid particles crossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q is the same. If area of cross- sections at these points are AP ,AR and AQ and speeds of ﬂuid particles are PP,v DR and v9, then mass of ﬂuid AmP crossing at AP Rin a small interval of time At is pPAPvP At. Similarly mass of ﬂuid AmR ﬂowing or crossing at AR in a small interval of time At is pPPARv At and mass of ﬂuid AmQ is pQAQvQ At crossing at A9. The mass of liquid ﬂowing out equals the mass ﬂowing in, holds in all cases. Therefore, pPAPvPAt— — pRARvR At— — pQAQvQAt (10.9) For ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuids Pp: PR: Pg Equation (10. 9) reduces to APvP =APvR = AgvQ (10.10) which is called the equation of continuity and it is a statement of conservation of mass in ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuids. In general Av = constant (10.1 1) Av gives the volume ﬂux or ﬂow rate and remains constant throughout the pipe of ﬂow. Thus, at narrower portions where the streamlines are closely spaced. velocity increases and its vice versa. From (Fig 10.7b) it is clear that AR > A9 or UR < v9, the ﬂuid is accelerated while passing from R to Q This is associated with a change in pressure in ﬂuid ﬂow in horizontal pipes. Steady ﬂow is achieved at low ﬂow speeds. Beyond a limiting value, called critical speed, this ﬂow loses steadiness and becomes turbulent. One sees this when a fast ﬂowing 2019-20",0

This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free fall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justiﬁed, let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric field: _(1.6 x 10“19 C) x (2.0 x 104 NC‘l) _ 1.67 x 10—27 kg = 1.9 x 1012 ms‘2 which is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m S”), the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even greater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored in this example. Example 1.9 Two point charges q1 and q2, of magnitude +10‘8 C and —10‘8 C, respectively, are placed 0.1 m apart. Calculate the electric fields at points A, B and C shown in Fig. 1.14.

148,960,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS examples of imbibition are absorption of water by seeds and dry wood. The pressure that is produced by the swelling of wood had been used by prehistoric man to split rocks and boulders. If it were not for the pressure due to imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of the soil into the open; they probably would not have been able to establish! Imbibition is also diffusion since water movement is along a concentration gradient; the seeds and other such materials have almost no water hence they absorb water easily. Water potential gradient between the absorbent and the liquid imbibed is essential for imbibition. In addition, for any substance to imbibe any liquid, afﬁnity between the adsorbant and the liquid is also a pre-requisite. 1 1.3 LONG DISTANCE TRANSPORT OF WATER At some earlier stage you might have carried out an experiment where you had placed a twig bearing white ﬂowers in coloured water and had watched it turn colour. On examining the cut end of the twig after a few hours you had noted the region through which the coloured water moved. ’Ihat experiment very easily demonstrates that the path of water movement is through the vascular bundles, more speciﬁcally, the xylem. Now we have to go further and try and understand the mechanism of movement of water and other substances up a plant. Long distance transport of substances within a plant cannot be by diffusion alone. Diffusion is a slow process. It can account for only short distance movement of molecules. For example, the movement of a molecule across a typical plant cell (about 50 um) takes approximately 2.5 s. At this rate, can you calculate how many years it would take for the movement of molecules over a distance of 1 m within a plant by diffusion alone? In large and complex organisms, often substances have to be moved to long distances. Sometimes the sites of production or absorption and sites of storage are too far from each other; diffusion or active transport would not sufﬁce. Special long distance transport systems become necessary so as to move substances across long distances and at a much faster rate. Water and minerals, and food are generally moved by a mass or bulk ﬂow system. Mass ﬂow is the movement of substances in bulk or en masse from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. It is a characteristic of mass ﬂow that substances, whether in solution or in suspension, are swept along at the same pace, as in a ﬂowing river. This is unlike diffusion where different substances move independently depending on their concentration gradients. Bulk ﬂow can be achieved either through a positive hydrostatic pressure gradient (e. g., a garden hose) or a negative hydrostatic pressure gradient (e. g., suction through a straw). 183",1
149,448,"90 PHYSICS 5.2 ARISTOTLE’S FALLACY The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C— 322 B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. According to this view, for example, an arrow shot from a bow keeps ﬂying since the air behind the arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of an elaborate framework of ideas developed by Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe. Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now known to be wrong and need not concern us. For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion. Aristotelian law of motion is ﬂawed, as we shall see. However, it is a natural view that anyone would hold from common experience. Even a small child playing with a simple (non-electric) toy-car on a ﬂoor knows intuitively that it needs to constantly drag the string attached to the toy- car with some force to keep it going. If it releases the string, it comes to rest. This experience is common to most terrestrial motion. External forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in motion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually come to rest. What is the ﬂaw in Aristotle’s argument? The answer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the ﬂoor opposes its motion. To counter this force, the child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force ( friction) by the ﬂoor. The corollary is: if there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. The opposing forces such as friction (solids) and viscous forces (for ﬂuids) are always present in the natural world. This explains why forces by external agencies are necessary to overcome the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform motion. Now we understand where Aristotle went wrong. He coded this practical experience in the form of a basic argument. To get at the 2019-20 true law of nature for forces and motion, one has to imagine a world in which uniform motion is possible with no frictional forces opposing. This is what Galileo did. 5.3 THE LAW OF INERTIA Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard. (iii) Motion on a horizontal plane is an intermediate situation. Galileo concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity (Fig. 5.1(a)). !__+.-. (i) (ii) (111} Fig. 5.1(a) Another experiment by Galileo leading to the same conclusion involves a double inclined plane. A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls down and climbs up the other. If the planes are smooth, the ﬁnal height of the ball is nearly the same as the initial height (a little less but never greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. If the slope of the second plane is decreased and the experiment repeated, the ball will still reach the same height, but in doing so, it will travel a longer distance. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance. In other words, its motion never ceases. This is, of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 5.1 (b)). Fig. 5.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo from observations of motion of a ball on a double inclined plane.",0
150,1220,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS distribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and females in a population is often presented graphically as age pyramid; its shape indicates whether a population is stationary, growing or declining. Ecological effects of any factors on a population are generally reﬂected in its size (population density), which may be expressed in different ways (numbers, biomass, per cent cover, etc.,) depending on the species. Populations grow through births and immigration and decline through deaths and emigration. When resources are unlimited, the growth is usually exponential but when resources become progressively limiting, the growth pattern turns logistic. In either case, growth is ultimately limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is a measure of the inherent potential of a population to grow. In nature populations of different species in a habitat do not live in isolation but interact in many ways. Depending on the outcome, these interactions between two species are classified as competition (both species suffer), predation and parasitism (one beneﬁts and the other suffers), commensalism (one benefits and the other is unaffected), amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and mutualism (both species benefit). Predation is a very important process through which trophic energy transfer is facilitated and some predators help in controlling their prey populations. Plants have evolved diverse morphological and chemical defenses against herbivory. In competition, it is presumed that the superior competitor eliminates the inferior one (the Competitive Exclusion Principle), but many closely related species have evolved various mechanisms which facilitate their co-existence. Some of the most fascinating cases of mutualism in nature are seen in plant-pollinator interactions. EXERCISES 1. How is diapause different from hibernation? 2.

151,1391,"STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION makes it believable that microscopic fungi too would become acceptable as food. 9.4 TISSUE CULTURE As traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with demand and to provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement, another technology called tissue culture got developed. What does tissue culture mean? It was learnt by scientists, during 1950s, that whole plants could be regenerated from explants, i.e., any part of a plant taken out and grown in a test tube, under sterile conditions in special nutrient media. This capacity to generate a whole plant from any cell/explant is called totipotency. You will learn how to accomplish this in higher classes. It is important to stress here that the nutrient medium must provide a carbon source such as sucrose and also inorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins, cytokinins etc. By application of these methods it is possible to achieve propagation of a large number of plants in very short durations. This method of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture is called micro- propagation. Each of these plants will be genetically identical to the original plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are somaclones. Many important food plants like tomato, banana, apple, etc., have been produced on commercial scale using this method. Try to visit a tissue culture laboratory with your teacher to better understand and appreciate the process. Another important application of the method is the recovery of healthy plants from diseased plants. Even if the plant is infected with a virus, the meristem (apical and axillary) is free of Virus. Hence, one can remove the meristem and grow it in vitro to obtain virus-free plants. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane, potato, etc. Scientists have even isolated single cells from plants and after digesting their cell walls have been able to isolate naked protoplasts (surrounded by plasma membranes). Isolated protoplasts from two different varieties of plants — each having a desirable character — can be fused to get hybrid protoplasts, which can be further grown to form a new plant. These hybrids are called somatic hybrids while the process is called somatic hybridisation. Imagine a situation when a protoplast of tomato is fused with that of potato, and then they are grown — to form new hybrid plants combining tomato and potato characteristics. Well, this has been achieved — resulting in formation of pomato; unfortunately this plant did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for its commercial utilisation. 2019—2020 I77",1
152,1189,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT embryos are some of the reasons which causes seed dormancy. This dormancy however can be overcome through natural means and various other man-made measures. For example, the seed coat barrier in some seeds can be broken by mechanical abrasions using knives, sandpaper, etc. or vigorous shaking. In nature, these abrasions are caused by microbial action, and passage through digestive tract of animals. Effect of inhibitory substances can be removed by subjecting the seeds to chilling conditions or by application of certain chemicals like gibberellic acid and nitrates. Changing the environmental conditions, such as light and temperature are other methods to overcome seed dormancy. SUMMARY Growth is one of the most conspicuous events in any living organism. It is an irreversible increase expressed in parameters such as size, area, length, height, volume, cell number etc. It conspicuously involves increased protoplasmic material. In plants, meristems are the sites of growth. Root and shoot apical meristems sometimes alongwith intercalary meristem, contribute to the elongation growth of plant axes.

These PGRs are synthesised in various parts of the plant; they control different differentiation and developmental events. Any PGR has diverse physiological effects on plants. Diverse PGRs also manifest similar effects. PGRs may act synergistically or antagonistically. Plant growth and development is also affected by light, temperature, nutrition, oxygen status, gravity and such external factors. Flowering in some plants is induced only when exposed to certain duration of photoperiod. Depending on the nature of photoperiod requirements, the plants are called short day plants, long day plants and day-neutral plants. Certain plants also need to be exposed to low temperature so as to hasten ﬂowering later in life. This treatement is known as vernalisation. 253",1
153,563,"Magnetism and Mutter It must not be assumed that there is a giant bar magnet deep inside the earth which is causing the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Although there are large deposits of iron inside the earth, it is highly unlikely that a large solid block of iron stretches from the magnetic north pole to the magnetic south pole. The earth’s core is very hot and molten, and the ions of iron and nickel are responsible for earth’s magnetism. This hypothesis seems very probable. Moon, which has no molten core, has no magnetic field, Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a weaker magnetic ﬁeld, while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has a fairly strong magnetic ﬁeld. However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and the energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood. These are several open questions which form an important area of continuing research. The variation of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld with position is also an interesting area of study. Charged particles emitted by the sun ﬂow towards the earth and beyond, in a stream called the solar wind. Their motion is affected by the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, and in turn, they affect the pattern of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The pattern of magnetic ﬁeld near the poles is quite different from that in other regions of the earth. The variation of earth’s magnetic ﬁeld with time is no less fascinating. There are short term variations taking place over centuries and long term variations taking place over a period of a million years. In a span of 240 years from 1580 to 1820 AD, over which records are available, the magnetic declination at London has been found to change by 35°, suggesting that the magnetic poles inside the earth change position with time. On the scale of a million years, the earth’s magnetic ﬁelds has been found to reverse its direction. Basalt contains iron, and basalt is emitted during volcanic activity. The little iron magnets inside it align themselves parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld at that place as the basalt cools and solidiﬁes. Geological studies of basalt containing such pieces of magnetised region have provided evidence for the change of direction of earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, several times in the past. 5.5 MAGNETISATION AND MAGNETIC INTENSITY The earth abounds with a bewildering variety of elements and compounds. In addition, we have been synthesising new alloys, compounds and even elements. One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these substances. In the present section, we deﬁne and explain certain terms which will help us to carry out this exercise. We have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic moment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they can give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We define magnetisation M of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per unit volume: m M = f (5.1 1) M is a vector with dimensions L‘1 A and is measured in a units of A m‘l. Consider a long solenoid of n turns per unit length and carrying a current I. The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to be given by 189 2019-20",0
154,975,"BIOLOGY 16.4. 1 Case Study of Organic Farming Integrated organic farming is a cyclical, zero-waste procedure, where waste products from one process are cycled in as nutrients for other processes. This allows the maximum utilisation of resource and increases the efﬁciency of production. Ramesh Chandra Dagar, a farmer in Sonipat, Haryana, is doing j ust this. He includes bee-keeping, dairy management, water harvesting, composting and agriculture in a chain of processes, which support each other and allow an extremely economical and sustainable venture. There is no need to use chemical fertilisers for crops, as cattle excreta (dung) are used as manure. Crop waste is used to create compost, which can be used as a natural fertiliser or can be used to generate natural gas for satisfying the energy needs of the farm. Enthusiastic about spreading information and help on the practice of integrated organic farming, Dagar has created the Haryana Kisan Welfare Club, with a current membership of 5000 farmers. 16.5 RADIOACTIVE WASTES Initially, nuclear energy was hailed as a non-polluting way for generating electricity. Later on, it was realised that the use of nuclear energy has two very serious inherent problems. The ﬁrst is accidental leakage, as occurred in the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl incidents and the second is safe disposal of radioactive wastes. Radiation, that is given off by nuclear waste is extremely damaging to organisms, because it causes mutations at a very high rate. At high doses, nuclear radiation is lethal but at lower doses, it creates various disorders, the most frequent of all being cancer. Therefore, nuclear waste is an extremely potent pollutant and has to be dealt with utmost caution. It has been recommended that storage of nuclear waste, after sufficient pre-treatment, should be done in suitably shielded containers buried within the rocks, about 500 m deep below the earth’s surface. However, this method of disposal is meeting stiff opposition from the public. Why do you think this method of disposal is not agreeable to many people? 16.6 GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND GLOBAL WARMING The term ‘Greenhouse effect’ has been derived from a phenomenon that occurs in a greenhouse. Have you ever seen a greenhouse? It looks like a small glass house and is used for growing plants especially during winter. In a greenhouse the glass panel lets the light in, but does not allow heat to escape. Therefore, the greenhouse warms up, very much like inside a car that has been parked in the sun for a few hours. The greenhouse effect is a naturally occurring phenomenon that is responsible for heating of Earth’s surface and atmosphere. You would be 2019—2020",1

156,933,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS synthesise a larger number of ATP molecules needed for cellular metabolism? In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondria and this requires 02. Aerobic respiration is the process that leads to a complete oxidation of organic substances in the presence of oxygen, and releases C02, water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate. This type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. We will look at these processes in the next section. 14.4 AEROBIC RESPIRATION For aerobic respiration to take place within the mitochondria, the ﬁnal product of glycolysis, pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. The crucial events in aerobic respiration are: ‘ The complete oxidation of pyruvate by the stepwise removal of all the hydrogen atoms, leaving three molecules of C02. ° The passing on of the electrons removed as part of the hydrogen atoms to molecular 02 with simultaneous synthesis of ATP. What is interesting to note is that the ﬁrst process takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria while the second process is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Pyruvate, which is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydrates in the cytosol, after it enters mitochondrial matrix undergoes om'dative decarboxylation by a complex set of reactions catalysed by pyruvic dehydrogenase.

The acetyl CoA then enters a cyclic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, more commonly called as Krebs’ cycle after the scientist Hans Krebs who ﬁrst elucidated it. 14.4. 1 Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle The TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic acid (0AA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 14.3). The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released. Citrate is then isomerised to isocitrate. It is followed by two successive steps of decarboxylation, leading to the formation of oc-ketoglutaric acid",1

160,1408,"11092CH16 BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION ‘- 7 ou have already learnt about the geomorphic processes particularly weathering and depth of weathering mantle in different climatic zones. See the Figure 6.2 in Chapter 6 in order to recapitulate. You should know that this weathering mantle is the basis for the diversity of vegetation and hence, the biodiversity. The basic cause for such weathering variations and resultant biodiversity is the input of solar energy and water. No wonder that the areas that are rich in these inputs are the areas of wide spectrum of biodiversity. Biodiversity as we have today is the result of 2.5-3.5 billion years of evolution. Before the advent of htunans, our earﬂi supported more biodiversity than in any other period. Since, the emergence of humans, however, biodiversity has begun a rapid decline, with one species after another bearing the brunt of extinction due to overuse. The number of species globally vary from 2 million to 100 million, with 10 million being the best estimate. Nevv species are regulally discovered most of which are yet to be classified (an estimate states that about 40 per cent of fresh water fishes from South America are not classified yet). Tropical forests are very rich in bio-diversity. Biodiversity is a system in constant evolution, from a view point of species, as well as from view point of an individual organism. The average half-life of a species is estimated at between one and four million years, and 99 per cent of the species that have ever lived on CHAPTER E. the earth are today extinct. Biodiversity is not found evenly on the earth. It is consistently richer in the tropics. As one approaches the polar regions, one finds larger and larger populations of fewer and fewer species. Biodiversity itself is a combination of two words, Bio (life) and diversity (variety). In simple terms, biodiversity is the number and variety of organisms found within a specified geographic region. It refers to the varieties of plants, animals and micro-organisms, the genes they contain and the ecosystems they form. It relates to the variability among living organisms on the earth, including the variability within and between the species and that within and between the ecosystems. Biodiversity is our living wealth. It is a result of hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history. Biodiversity can be discussed at three levels : (i) Genetic diversity; (ii) Species diversity; (iii) Ecosystem diversity. Genetic Diversity Genes are the basic building blocks of various life forms. Genetic biodiversity refers to the variation of genes within species. Groups of individual organisms having certain similarities in their physical characteristics are called species. Human beings genetically belong to the homo sapiens group and also differ in their characteristics such as height, colour, physical appearance, etc., considerably. This is due to genetic diversity. This genetic diversity is essential for a healthy breeding of population of species. 2019-2020",2
161,1235,"BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES 17 . 1 . 1 Human Respiratory System We have a pair of external nostrils opening out above the upper lips. It leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal chamber opens into the pharynx, a portion of which is the common passage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx region into the trachea. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound production and hence called the sound box. During swallowing glottis can be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous ﬂap called epiglottis to prevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tube extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of 5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primaly bronchi. Each bronchi undergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi and bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. The tracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled and vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branching network of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure 17 . 1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura, with pleural ﬂuid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface.

(9.33)], when the image is formed at infinity, is m=mm = i 2 o e f0 L (9.45) Clearly, to achieve a large magnification of a small object (hence the name microscope), the objective and eyepiece should have small focal lengths. In practice, it is difﬁcult to make the focal length much smaller than 1 cm. Also large lenses are required to make L large. For example, with an objective with fo = 1.0 cm, and an eyepiece with focal length fe = 2.0 cm, and a tube length of 20 cm, the magnification is rummage = a x g = 250 1 2 Various other factors such as illumination of the object, contribute to the quality and visibility of the image. In modern microscopes, multi- component lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to improve image quality by minimising various optical aberrations (defects) in lenses. 9.8.2 Telescope The telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects (Fig. 9.29). It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective has a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece. Light from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed in the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magniﬁes this image producing a final inverted image.

165,1185,"PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION in the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence transmitted from one generation to the other without any change or alteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such an alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation. A number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated with the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes. 5.8.2 Mendelian Disorders Broadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories — Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly determined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders are transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in the principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian disorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common and prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic ﬁbrosis, Sickle- cell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc. It is important to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be dominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand whether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is evident that this X—linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier female to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 5. 14 for dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design pedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.

This defect is due to mutation in certain genes present in the X chromosome. It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and only about 0.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to red-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome and females have two. The son of a woman who carries 2019-2020",1

170,287,"Electric Charges and Fields by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the material body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material body can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when a body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why we have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing the bodies. 1.3 CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS A metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of being charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging. Suppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and the other end to a negatively charged plastic rod. We will find that the pith ball acquires a negative charge. If a similar experiment is repeated with a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take place from the plastic rod to the pith ball. Why does the transfer of charge not take place from the rod to the ball? Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others do not. Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are called conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass, porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of electricity through them. They are called insulators. Most substances fall into one of the two classes stated above*. When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets distributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some charge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn why this happens in the next chapter. This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the ground as both are conductors of electricity. When we bring a charged body in contact with the earth, all the excess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current to pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our body). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called grounding or earthing. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical circuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth and thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are used in buildings for the purpose of earthing near the mains supply. The electric wiring in our houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth. The first two carry * There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the movement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and insulators. 2019-20",0

The volume element Av is macroscopically small but contains a very large number of molecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the volume element Av has no net charge (though it has net dipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one dipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole. However, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the electric ﬁeld, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen in Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain unneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at the left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced charges due to the external field. Thus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged surfaces with induced surface charge densities, say 6p and —c7p.

The conductors have charges, say Q1 and Q2, and potentials V1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q and — Q, with potential difference V = V1 — V2 between them. We shall consider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a single conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at infinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the two terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though this, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors — the total charge of the capacitor is zero. The electric ﬁeld in the region between the conductors is proportional to the charge Q. That is, if the charge on the capacitor is, say doubled, the electric field will also be doubled at every point. (This follows from the direct proportionality between ﬁeld and charge implied by Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.)

If the object were a human being, he or she will not feel his weight since there is no upward force on him. Thus, when an object is in free fall, it is weightless and this phenomenon is usually called the phenomenon of weightlessness. In a satellite around the earth, every part and parcel of the satellite has an acceleration towards the centre of the earth which is exactly the value of earth’s acceleration due to gravity at that position. Thus in the satellite everything inside it is in a state of free fall. This is just as if we were falling towards the earth from a height. Thus, in a manned satellite, people inside experience no gravity. Gravity for us defines the vertical direction and thus for them there are no horizontal or vertical directions, all directions are the same. Pictures of astronauts ﬂoating in a satellite show this fact. SUMMARY 1.

174,57,"l Physics APPENDIX 11.1 The history of wave-particle ﬂip-ﬂop What is light? This question has haunted mankind for a long time. But systematic experiments were done by scientists since the dawn of the scientific and industrial era, about four centuries ago. Around the same time, theoretical models about what light is made of were developed. While building a model in any branch of science, it is essential to see that it is able to explain all the experimental observations existing at that time. It is therefore appropriate to summarize some observations about light that were known in the seventeenth century. The properties of light known at that time included (a) rectilinear propagation of light, (b) reﬂection from plane and curved surfaces, [c] refraction at the boundary of two media, [d] dispersion into various colours, [e] high speed. Appropriate laws were formulated for the first four phenomena. For example, Snell formulated his laws of refraction in 1621. Several scientists right from the days of Galileo had tried to measure the speed of light. But they had not been able to do so. They had only concluded that it was higher than the limit of their measurement. Two models of light were also proposed in the seventeenth century. Descartes, in early decades of seventeenth century, proposed that light consists of particles, while Huygens, around 1650—60, proposed that light consists of waves. Descartes’ proposal was merely a philosophical model, devoid of any experiments or scientific arguments. Newton soon after, around 1660-70, extended Descartes’ particle model, known as corpuscular theory, built it up as a scientific theory, and explained various known properties with it. These models, light as waves and as particles, in a sense, are quite opposite of each other. But both models could explain all the known properties of light. There was nothing to choose between them. The history of the development of these models over the next few centuries is interesting. Bartholinus, in 1669, discovered double refraction of light in some crystals, and Huygens, in 1678, was quick to explain it on the basis of his wave theory of light. In spite of this, for over one hundred years, Newton’s particle model was firmly believed and preferred over the wave model. This was partly because of its simplicity and partly because of Newton’s inﬂuence on contemporary physics. Then in 180 1, Young performed his double-slit experiment and observed interference fringes. This phenomenon could be explained only by wave theory. It was realized that diffraction was also another phenomenon which could be explained only by wave theory. In fact, it was a natural consequence of Huygens idea of secondary wavelets emanating from every point in the path of light. These experiments could not be explained by assuming that light consists of particles. Another phenomenon of polarisation was discovered around 1810, and this too could be naturally explained by the wave theory. Thus wave theory of Huygens came to the forefront and Newton’s particle theory went into the background. This situation again continued for almost a century. Better experiments were performed in the nineteenth century to determine the speed of light. With more accurate experiments, a value of 3X 108 m/ s for speed of light in vacuum was arrived at. Around 1860, Maxwell proposed his equations of electromagnetism and it was realized that all electromagnetic phenomena known at that time could be explained by Maxwell’s four equations. Soon Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields could propagate through empty space [vacuum] in the form of electromagnetic waves. He calculated the speed of these waves and arrived at a theoretical value of 2.998X 108 m/s. The close agreement of this value with the experimental value suggested that light consists of electromagnetic waves. In 1887 Hertz demonstrated the generation and detection of such waves. This established the wave theory of light on a firm footing. We might say that while eighteenth century belonged to the particle model, the nineteenth century belonged to the wave model of light. Vast amounts of experiments were done during the period 1850— 1900 on heat and related phenomena, an altogether different area of physics. Theories and models like kinetic theory and thermodynamics were developed which quite successfully explained the various phenomena, except one. 412 2019-20",0
175,1280,"38 BIOLOGY free-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called prothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to grow. Because of this speciﬁc restricted requirement and the need for water for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and restricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of antherozoids — the male gametes released from the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete with the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote. Zygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte which is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the pteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called homosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known as heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female gametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes for variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos take place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to the seed habit considered an important step in evolution. The pteridophytes are further classiﬁed into four classes: Psilopsida (Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum) and Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum). 3.4 GYMNOSPERMS The gymnosperms (gymnos : naked, sperma: seeds) are plants in which the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, both before and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, are not covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees or tall trees and shrubs Wigure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giant redwood tree Sequoia is one of the tallest tree species. The roots are generally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with N2- ﬁxing cyanobacteria. The stems are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The leaves may be simple or compound. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a few years. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremes of temperature, humidity and wind. In conifers, the needle-like leaves reduce the surface area. Their thick cuticle and sunken stomata also help to reduce water loss.",1
176,866,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 23 called conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction is by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are produced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle involves the following three steps: (i) Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes called plasmogamy. (ii) Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy. (iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores. When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid hyphae of compatible mating types come together and fuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells immediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening dikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs; such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is called dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei fuse and the cells become diploid. The fungi form fruiting bodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to formation of haploid spores. The morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore formation and fruiting bodies form the basis for the division of the kingdom into various classes. 2.3. 1 Phycomycetes Members of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats and on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as obligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate and coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by zoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These spores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A zygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These gametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or dissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common examples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the bread mould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungi on mustard). 2.3.2 Ascomycetes Commonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes are mostly multicellular, e. g., Penicillium or rarely unicellular, e. g., yeast (Saccharomyces). They are saprophytic, decomposers, parasitic or coprophilous (growing on dung). Mycelium 201 9-2020 Figure 2.5 Fungi: (a) Mucor (b) Aspergillus (c) Agaricus",1

Pollination is the mechanism to transfer pollen grains from the anther to the stigma. Pollinating agents are either abiotic (wind and water) or biotic (animals). Pollen-pistil interaction involves all events from the landing of pollen grains on the stigma until the pollen tube enters the embryo sac (when the pollen is compatible) or pollen inhibition (when the pollen is incompatible). Following compatible pollination, pollen grain germinates on the stigma and the resulting pollen tube grow through the style, enter the ovules and ﬁnally discharges two male gametes in one of the synergids. Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion events occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion. The products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid primary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell). Zygote develops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the endosperm tissue. Formation of endosperm always precedes development of the embryo. The developing embryo passes through different stages such as the proembryo, globular and heart-shaped stages before maturation. Mature dicotyledonous embryo has two cotyledons and an embryonal axis with epicotyl and hypocotyl. Embryos of monocotyledons have a single cotyledon. After fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules develop into seeds. A phenomenon called apomixis is found in some angiosperms, particularly in grasses. It results in the formation of seeds without fertilisation. Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and agriculture. Some angiosperms produce more than one embryo in their seed. This phenomenon is called polyembryony. l/AMA EXERCISES 1. Name the parts of an angiosperm ﬂower in which development of male and female gametophyte take place. 2.

To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which an external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential energy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the charge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal of the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of the source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference between the two terminals of a source in open circuit. Ohm’s law: The electric current I ﬂowing through a substance is proportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V o< I or V = RI, where R is called the resistance of the substance. The unit of resistance is ohm: 1:2 = 1 VA'l. The resistance R of a conductor depends on its length l and cross—sectional area A through the relation, R=P_l A where p, called resistivity is a property of the material and depends on temperature and pressure. Electrical resistivity of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals have low resistivity, in the range of 10”8 Q m to 10‘6 Q m. Insulators like glass and rubber have 1022 to 1024 times greater resistivity. Semiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of resistivity on a logarithmic scale. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some cases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and negative ions carry the electric current. Current density j gives the amount of charge ﬂowing per second per unit area normal to the ﬂow, j=nqu where n is the number density [number per unit volume) of charge carriers each of charge q, and 11d is the drift velocity of the charge carriers. For electrons q = — e. If j is normal to a cross—sectional area A and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through the area is nevd A. 2019-20",0

This prediction is opposite to the prediction from the corpuscular model of light and as later experiments showed, the prediction of the wave theory is correct. Now, if 0 represents the speed of light in vacuum, then, ”1 2 _ (10.4) and n2 = E (10.5) are known as the refractive indices of medium 1 and medium 2, respectively.

Further, if 11 and 12 denote the wavelengths of light in medium 1 and medium 2, respectively and if the distance BC is equal to it 1 then the distance AE will be equal to 7L2 (because if the crest from B has reached C in time ”F, then the crest from A should have also reached E in time T); thus, i _ E _ a 12 AE v2 or i = ”—2 11 1.2 (10.7) The above equation implies that when a wave gets refracted into a denser medium (01 > 02) the wavelength and the speed of propagation decrease but the frequency v (= v/7») remains the same. 4—) 8 ‘6: o) )— 2 o. o. o Q “o c m a) U c m c o U) o 5.1 d o '5 U m 8: cu L.‘ d .9 4—) U g E 'o :35 U c o 5—: g )— o2 ._. .E Q— o s: o g: m h 4—) U) c o E a) Q \ 1) CL C). ‘: \ E O ’~€ ""a re .4 L.” E 3 § § 9. a H .2 10.3.2 Refraction at a rarer medium We now consider refraction of a plane wave at a rarer medium, i.e., 02 > 01- Proceeding in an exactly similar manner we can construct a refracted wavefront as shown in Fig. 10.5.

A magnetic field of 2.83 X 10’4 T curves the path of the electrons in a circular orbit of radius 12.0 cm.

183,999,"164 You have studied mitosis in onion root tip cells. It has 16 chromosomes in each cell. Can you tell how many chromosomes will the cell have at G1 phase, after S phase, and after M phase? Also, what will be the DNA content of the cells at G1, after S and at G2, if the content after M phase is 2C? BiowGY Some cells in the adult animals do not appear to exhibit division (e.g., heart cells) and many other cells divide only occasionally, as needed to replace cells that have been lost because of injury or cell death. These cells that do not divide further exit G1 phase to enter an inactive stage called quiescent stage (Go) of the cell cycle. Cells in this stage remain metabolically active but no longer proliferate unless called on to do so depending on the requirement of the organism. In animals, mitotic cell division is only seen in the diploid somatic cells. However, there are few exceptions to this where haploid cells divide by mitosis, for example, male honey bees. Against this, the plants can show mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells. From your recollection of examples of alternation of generations in plants (Chapter 3) identify plant species and stages at which mitosis is seen in haploid cells. 10.2 M PHASE This is the most dramatic period of the cell cycle, involving a major reorganisation of virtually all components of the cell. Since the number of chromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same, it is also called as equational division. Though for convenience mitosis has been divided into four stages of nuclear division (karyokinesis), it is very essential to understand that cell division is a progressive process and very clear-cut lines cannot be drawn between various stages. Karyokinesis involves following four stages: 0 Prophase o Metaphase o Anaphase o Telophase 1 0.2.1 Prophase Prophase which is the first stage of karyokinesis of mitosis follows the S and G2 phases of interphase. In the S and G2 phases the new DNA molecules formed are not distinct but intertwined. Prophase is marked by the initiation of condensation of chromosomal material. The chromosomal material becomes untangled during the process of chromatin condensation (Figure 10.2 a). The centrosome, which had undergone duplication during S phase of interphase, now begins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. The completion of prophase can thus be marked by the following characteristic events: 0 Chromosomal material condenses to form compact mitotic chromosomes. Chromosomes are seen to be composed of two chromatids attached together at the centromere. O Centrosome which had undergone duplication during interphase, begins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. Each centrosome radiates out microtubules called asters. The two asters together with spindle fibres forms mitotic apparatus. 2019-2020",1

The photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the potential of collector plate A with respect to the emitter plate C. The intensity and v / Commutator frequency of the incident light can be varied, as can the potential difference V between the emitter C and the collector A.

It is found that the photocurrent increases linearly Intensity of light —> with intensity of incident light as shown graphically in Fig. 1 1.2.

We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and measure the resulting photocurrent each time. It is found that the photoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating) potential. At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the emitted electrons are collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current becomes maximum or saturates. If we increase the accelerating potential of plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase. This maximum value of the photoelectric current is called saturation current. Saturation current corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by the emitter plate C reach the collector plate A. We now apply a negative (retarding) potential to the plate A with respect to the plate C and make it increasingly negative gradually. When the 2019-20",0

In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the different radii, the arrangement is called radial such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem. 6.3 ANATOMY OF DICOTYLEDONOUS AND MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS For a better understanding of tissue organisation of roots, stems and leaves, it is convenient to study the transverse sections of the mature zones of these organs. 6.3. 1 Dicotyledonous Root Look at Figure 6.6 (a), it shows the transverse section of the sunﬂower root. The internal tissue organisation is as follows: The outermost layer is epiblema. Many of the cells of epiblema protrude in the form of unicellular root hairs. The cortex consists of several layers of thin-walled parenchyma cells",1
186,1168,"190 BIOLOGY 1 1.5.2 Translocation of Mineral Ions After the ions have reached xylem through active or passive uptake, or a combination of the two, their further transport up the stem to all parts of the plant is through the transpiration stream. The chief sinks for the mineral elements are the growing regions of the plant, such as the apical and lateral meristems, young leaves, developing ﬂowers, fruits and seeds, and the storage organs. Unloading of mineral ions occurs at the ﬁne vein endings through diffusion and active uptake by these cells. Mineral ions are frequently remobilised, particularly from older, senescing parts. Older dying leaves export much of their mineral content to younger leaves. Similarly, before leaf fall in decidous plants, minerals are removed to other parts. Elements most readily mobilised are phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium. Some elements that are structural components like calcium are not remobilised. An analysis of the xylem exudates shows that though some of the nitrogen travels as inorganic ions, much of it is carried in the organic form as amino acids and related compounds. Similarly, small amounts of P and S are carried as organic compounds. In addition, small amount of exchange of materials does take place between xylem and phloem. Hence, it is not that we can clearly make a distinction and say categorically that xylem transports only inorganic nutrients while phloem transports only organic materials, as was traditionally believed. I 1.6 PHLOEM TRANSPORT: FLOW FROM SOURCE T0 SINK Food, primarily sucrose, is transported by the vascular tissue phloem from a source to a sink. Usually the source is understood to be that part of the plant which synthesises the food, i.e., the leaf, and sink, the part that needs or stores the food. But, the source and sink may be reversed depending on the season, or the plant’s needs. Sugar stored in roots may be mobilised to become a source of food in the early spring when the buds of trees, act as sink; they need energy for growth and development of the photosynthetic apparatus. Since the source-sink relationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can be upwards or downwards, i.e., bi-directional. This contrasts with that of the xylem where the movement is always unidirectional, i.e., upwards. Hence, unlike one-way ﬂow of water in transpiration, food in phloem sap can be transported in any required direction so long as there is a source of sugar and a sink able to use, store or remove the sugar. Phloem sap is mainly water and sucrose, but other sugars, hormones and amino acids are also transported or translocated through phloem.",1
187,1074,"MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 5.5. 1 .3 Androecium Androecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which represents the male reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a filament and an anther. Each anther is usually bilobed and each lobe has two chambers, the pollen-sacs. The pollen grains are produced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen is called staminode. Stamens of ﬂower may be united with other members such as petals or among themselves. When stamens are attached to the petals, they are epipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when attached to the perianth as in the ﬂowers of lily. The stamens in a ﬂower may either remain free (polyandrous) or may be united in varying degrees. The stamens may be united into one bunch or one bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose, or two bundles (diadelphous) as in pea, or into more than two bundles (polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length of filaments within a ﬂower, as in Salvia and mustard. 5.5. 1 .4 Gynoecium Gynoecium is the female reproductive part of the ﬂower and is made up of one or more carpels. A carpel consists of three parts namely stigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which lies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the stigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the receptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more ovules attached to a ﬂattened, cushion-like placenta. When more than one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose) and are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when carpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the ovules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit. Placentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known as placentation. The placentation are of different types namely, marginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.16). In marginal placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the ventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge forming two rows, as in pea. When the placenta is axial and the ovules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is said to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In parietal placentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or on peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two- chambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard and Argemone. When the ovules are borne on central axis and septa are absent, as in Dianthus and Primrose the placentation is 2019-2020 75 (b) (6) Figure 5.16 Types of placentation : (a) Marginal (b) Axile (c) Parietal (d) Free central (e) Basal",1

These can arise due to random and unpredictable ﬂuctuations in experimental conditions (e.g. unpredictable ﬂuctuations in temperature, voltage supply, mechanical vibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal (unbiased) errors by the observer taking readings, etc. For example, when the same person repeats the same observation, it is very likely that he may get different readings everytime. Least count error The smallest value that can be measured by the measuring instrument is called its least count. All the readings or measured values are good only up to this value. The least count error is the error associated with the resolution of the instrument. For example, a vernier callipers has the least count as 0.01 cm; a spherometer may have a least count of 0.001 cm. Least count error belongs to the category of random errors but within a limited size; it occurs with both systematic and random errors. If we use a metre scale for measurement of length, it may have graduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or interval. Using instruments of higher precision, improving experimental techniques, etc., we can reduce the least count error. Repeating the observations several times and taking the arithmetic mean of all the observations, the mean value would be very close to the true value of the measured quantity. 2.6.1 Absolute Error. Relative Error and Percentage Error (a) Suppose the values obtained in several measurements are al, a2, a3...., an.

The magnitude of the difference between the individual measurement and the true value of the quantity is called the absolute error of the measurement. This is denoted by |Aa |.

Then the errors in the individual measurement values from the true value, are = a1 — a Aal , mean A612 = a2 — am an’ Aa n = an. — amean The Aa calculated above may be positive in certain cases and negative in some other cases.

Suppose she hears a whistle sounded by the driver of the train. What frequency will she measure or hear? Here both the observer and the source are moving with the same velocity, so there will be no shift in frequency and the passenger will note the natural frequency. But an observer outside who is stationary with respect to the track will note a higher frequency if the train is approaching him and a lower frequency when it recedes from him. Note that we have defined the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction. Therefore, if the observer is moving towards the source, we has a positive (numerical) value whereas if 0 is moving away from S, DC has a negative value. On the other hand, if S is moving away from 0, US has a positive value whereas if it is moving towards 0, US has a negative value. The sound emitted by the source travels in all directions. It is that part of sound coming towards the observer which the observer receives and detects. Therefore, the relative velocity of sound with respect to the observer is v+ Do in all cases. Example 15.7 A rocket is moving at a speed of 200 m 5’1 towards a stationary target. While moving, it emits a wave of frequency 1000 Hz. Some of the sound reaching the target gets reﬂected back to the rocket as an echo. Calculate (1) the frequency of the sound as detected by the target and (2) the frequency of the echo as detected by the rocket. Answer (1) The observer is at rest and the source is moving with a speed of 200 m S'l. Since this is comparable with the velocity of sound, 330 m S'l, we must use Eq. (15.50) and not the approximate Eq. (15.51). Since the source is approaching a stationary target, v0 = O, and us must be replaced by —vs. Thus, we have —1 v v = v0[l— Ts] v = 1000 HZ X [1 — 200 m S'1/330 m s4]-1 : 2540 HZ (2) The target is now the source (because it is the source of echo) and the rocket’s detector is now the detector or observer (because it detects echo). Thus, vs = O and v0 has a positive value. The frequency of the sound emitted by the source (the target) is v, the frequency intercepted by the target and not v0.

The illustration is from a 400 year old book to emphasise that the making of permanent magnets is an old art. One can also hold a steel rod and stroke it with one end of a bar magnet a large number of times, always in the same sense to make a permanent magnet. An efficient way to make a permanent magnet is to place a ferromagnetic rod in a solenoid and pass a current. The magnetic ﬁeld of the solenoid magnetises the rod. The hysteresis curve (Fig. 5.14) allows us to select suitable materials for permanent magnets.

Steel is work PllbliSth in 1600 and one-favoured choice. It has a slightly smaller retentivity than amhored by William Gilben' soft iron but this is outweighed by the much smaller coercivity the court physician to Queen of soft iron. Other suitable materials for permanent magnets Elizabeth of England. are alnico, cobalt steel and ticonal. Core of electromagnets are made of ferromagnetic materials which have high permeability and low retentivity. Soft iron is a suitable material for electromagnets. On placing a soft iron rod in a solenoid and passing a current, we increase the magnetism of the solenoid by a thousand fold. When we switch off the solenoid current, the magnetism is effectively switched off since the soft iron core has a low retentivity. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.16. 1.3.

193,502,"358 PHYSICS d2X dx mdt2 +bdt +kx— Focos codt (14.37b) This is the equation of an oscillator of mass m on which a periodic force of (angular) frequency cod is applied. The oscillator, initially, oscillates with its natural frequency a). When we apply the external periodic force, the oscillations with the natural frequency die out, and then the body oscillates with the (angular) frequency of the external periodic force. Its displacement, after the natural oscillations die out, is given by x(t) = Acos (wdt + ¢) (14.38) where tis the time measured from the moment when we apply the periodic force. The amplitude A is a function of the forced frequency cod and the natural frequency (0. Analysis shows that it is given by FD A _ 2 1/2 {m2 (wz —(031) + aﬁbz} (14.393) and tan (1) = —v0 (14.39b) wdxo where m is the mass of the particle and v0 and x0 are the velocity and the displacement of the particle at time t = 0, which is the moment when we apply the periodic force. Equation (14.39) shows that the amplitude of the forced oscillator depends on the (angular) frequency of the driving force. We can see a different behaviour of the oscillator when cod is far from a) and when it is close to a). We consider these two cases. (a) Small Damping, Driving Frequency far from Natural Frequency : In this case, cod b will be much smaller than m(w2 —a):), and we can neglect that term. Then Eq. (14.39) reduces to F A = —O (14.40) m(w2—a)f,) Fig. 14.21 shows the dependence of the displacement amplitude of an oscillator on the angular frequency of the driving force for different amounts of damping present in the system. It may be noted that in all cases the amplitude is the greatest when cod /w = 1. The curves in this figure show that smaller the damping, the taller and narrower is the resonance peak. 2019-20 b=50g 5 (least Amplitude 0.6 0.8 1.0 1 .2 1 .4 cod/w Fig. 14.21 The displacement amplitude of a forced oscillator as a function of the angular frequency of the driving force. The amplitude is the greatest at wd/ (0 =1 , the resonance condition. The three curves correspond to different extents of damping present in the system. The curves 1 and 3 correspond to minimum and maximum damping in the system. If we go on changing the driving frequency, the amplitude tends to infinity when it equals the natural frequency. But this is the ideal case of zero damping, a case which never arises in a real system as the damping is never perfectly zero. You must have experienced in a swing that when the timing of your push exactly matches with the time period of the swing, your swing gets the maximum amplitude. This amplitude is large, but not infinity, because there is always some damping in your swing. This will become clear in the (b). (b) Driving Frequency Close to Natural Frequency : If cod is very close to a), m ((02—503) would be much less than cod b, for any reasonable value of b, then Eq.

194,1581,"6 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements 1.4 Nature and Classes of Shares Shares, refer to the units into which the total share capital of a company is divided. Thus, a share is a fractional part of the share capital and forms the basis of ownership interest in a company. The persons who contribute money through shares are called shareholders. The amount of authorised capital, together with the number of shares in which it is divided, is stated in the Memorandum of Association but the classes of shares in which the company's capital is to be divided, along with their respective rights and obligations, are prescribed by the Articles of Association of the company. As per The Companies Act, a company can issue two types of shares (1) preference shares, and (2) equity shares (also called ordinary shares). 1 .4. 1 Preference Shares According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 20 13, a preference share is one, which fulﬁls the following conditions : (a) That it carries a preferential right to dividend to be paid either as a fixed amount payable to preference shareholders or an amount calculated by a ﬁxed rate of the nominal value of each share before any dividend is paid to the equity shareholders. (b) That with respect to capital it carries or will carry, on the winding up of the company, the preferential right to the repayment of capital before anything is paid to equity shareholders. However, notwithstanding the above two conditions, a holder of the preference share may have a right to participate fully or to a limited extent in the surpluses of the company as specified in the Memorandum or Articles of the company. Thus, the preference shares can be participating and non- participating. Similarly, these shares can be cumulative or non—cumulative, and redeemable or irredeemable. 1 .4.2 Equity Shares According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 20 13, an equity share is a share which is not a preference share. In other words, shares which do not enjoy any preferential right in the payment of dividend or repayment of capital, are termed as equity/ ordinary shares. The equity shareholders are entitled to share the distributable proﬁts of the company after satisfying the dividend rights of the preference share holders. The dividend on equity shares is not ﬁxed and it may",3

Inner membrane Majority of the chloroplasts of the green plants are found in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. These are lens-shaped, oval, ThylakOid spherical, discoid or even ribbon-like Stroma organelles having variable length (5- lOum) lamella and width (2-4um). Their number varies from 1 per cell of the Chlamydomonas, a green alga to 20-40 per cell in the mesophyll. Like mitochondria, the chloroplasts are also double membrane bound. Of the two, the inner chloroplast membrane is relatively less permeable. The space limited by the inner membrane of the chloroplast is called the stroma. A number of organised ﬂattened membranous sacs called the thylakoids, are present in the stroma (Figure 8.8). Thylakoids are arranged in stacks like the piles of coins called grana (singular: granum) or the intergranal thylakoids. In addition, there are ﬂat membranous tubules called the stroma lamellae connecting the thylakoids of the different grana. The membrane of the thylakoids enclose a space called a lumen. The stroma of the chloroplast contains enzymes required for the synthesis of carbohydrates and proteins. It also contains small, double- stranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes. Chlorophyll pigments are present in the thylakoids. The ribosomes of the chloroplasts are smaller (708) than the cytoplasmic ribosomes (808). 8.5.6 Ribosomes Ribosomes are the granular structures ﬁrst observed under the electron microscope as dense particles by George Palade (1953). They are Largﬁ composed of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins and subunit are not surrounded by any membrane. The eukaryotic ribosomes are 808 while the Small 7 prokaryotic ribosomes are 708. Each ribosome has two "" ' subunits, larger and smaller subunits (Fig 8.9). The two subunit Figure 8.9 Ribosome subunits of 808 ribosomes are 608 and 408 while that of 708 ribosomes are 508 and 308. Here ‘8’ (Svedberg’s Unit) stands for the sedimentation coefficient; it is indirectly a measure of density and size. Both 7 OS and 808 ribosomes are composed of two subunits. 8.5.7 Cytoskeleton An elaborate network of filamentous proteinaceous structures consisting of microtubules, microﬁlaments and intermediate filaments present in the cytoplasm is collectively referred to as the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton in a cell are involved in many functions such as mechanical support, motility, maintenance of the shape of the cell. 201 9-2020",1

197,674,"MOTION IN A PLANE 85 — POINTS TO PONDER l. The path length traversed by an object between two points is. in general. not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases. the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. 2. In View of point 1 above. the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement. 3. The vector equations [4.3321] and (4.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course, you can always resolve them along any two independent axes. 4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform circular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its direction is changing. 5.

We will now try to understand how a junction is formed and how the junction behaves under the inﬂuence of external applied voltage (also called bias). 14.5.1 p-n junction formation Consider a thin p-type silicon (p-Si) semiconductor wafer. By adding precisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer can be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a semiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and n-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region. Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction: diffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more compared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration of electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the concentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side to n-side (p —> n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n —> p). This motion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction. When an electron diffuses from n —> p, it leaves behind an ionised donor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is bonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse from n —> p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on n-side of the junction is developed. Similarly, when a hole diffuses from p —> 11 due to the concentration gradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is immobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or negative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed. This space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known as depletion region as the electrons and holes taking part in the initial movement across the junction depleted the region of its free charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness of depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a micrometre. Due to the 999939 positive space-charge region on n-side of the junction and p 33$: n negative space charge region on p-side of the junction, 966969 an electric field directed from positive charge towards :eeee: negative charge develops.

A relative motion between the different layers of the ﬂuid is set and, as a result, the body experiences a retarding force. Falling of a raindrop and swinging of a pendulum bob are some common examples of such motion. It is seen that the viscous force is proportional to the velocity of the object and is opposite to the direction of motion. The other quantities on which the force Fdepends are viscosity 1] of the ﬂuid and radius a of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (1819— 1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly the viscous drag force F as F=67t77av (10.19) This is known as Stokes’ law. We shall not derive Stokes’ law. This law is an interesting example of retarding force, which is proportional to velocity. We can study its consequences on an object falling through a viscous medium. We consider a raindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to gravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding force also increases. Finally, when viscous force plus buoyant force becomes equal to the force due to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so does the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then descends with a constant velocity. Thus, in equilibrium, this terminal velocity vt is given by 67mm)t = (475/ 3) a3 (9-0)!) 2019-20 where p and o are mass densities of sphere and the ﬂuid, respectively. We obtain v. = 2a2 (9-619 / (911) (1020} So the terminal velocity vt depends on the square of the radius of the sphere and inversely on the viscosity of the medium.

If an air mass is fully lifted above the land surface, it is called the occluded front. The fronts occur in middle latitudes and are characterised by steep gradient in temperature and pressure. They bring abrupt changes in temperature and cause the air to rise to form clouds and cause precipitation. Extra Tropical Cyclones The systems developing in the mid and high latitude, beyond the tropics are called the middle latitude or extra tropical cyclones. The passage of front causes abrupt changes in the weather conditions over the area in the middle and high latitudes. Extra tropical cyclones form along the polar front. Initially, the front is stationary. In the northern hemisphere, warm air blows from the south and cold air from the north of the front. When the pressure drops along the front, the warm air moves northwards and the cold air move towards, south setting in motion an FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY anticlockwise cyclonic circulation. The cyclonic circulation leads to a well developed extra tropical cyclone, with a warm front and a cold front. The plan and cross section of a well developed cyclone is given in Figure 10.9. There are pockets of warm air or warm sector wedged between the forward and the rear cold air or cold sector. The warm air glides over the cold air and a sequence of clouds appear over the sky ahead of the warm front and cause precipitation. The cold front approaches the warm air from behind and pushes the warm air up. As a result, cumulus clouds develop along the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front ultimately overtaking the warm front. The warm air is completely lifted up and the front is occluded and the cyclone dissipates. The processes of wind circulation both at the surface and aloft are closely interlinked. The extra tropical cyclone differs from the tropical cyclone in number of ways. The extra tropical cyclones have a clear frontal system Figure 10. 9 : Extra tropical cyclones 2019-2020",2

They also help in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm called chromatophores which contain pigments. Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thin ﬁlamentous extensions from their cell wall called ﬂagella. Bacteria show a range in the number and arrangement of ﬂagella. Bacterial ﬂagellum is composed of three parts — ﬁlament, hook and basal body. The ﬁlament is the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside. Besides ﬂagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of the bacteria but do not play a role in motility. The pili are elongated tubular structures made of a special protein. The fimbriae are small bristle like fibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to help attach the bacteria to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues. 8.4.2 Ribosomes and Inclusion Bodies In prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane of the cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of two subunits - 508 and SOS units which when present together form 708 prokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain called polyribosomes or polysome. The ribosomes of a polysome translate the mRNA into proteins. Inclusion bodies: Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored in the cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound by any membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphate granules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuoles are found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria. 8.5 EUKARYOTIC CELLS The eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In eukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm through the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells possess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition, eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal structures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes. All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different as the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which are absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles which are absent in almost all plant cells (Figure 8.3). 129",1

208,466,"440 l Physics atomic electrons is thus (—Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge of the nucleus is (+Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom is, therefore, exactly Z, the atomic number. Discovery of Neutron Since the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they must contain only one proton each. But the masses of the nuclei of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3. Therefore, the nuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain, in addition to a proton, some neutral matter. The amount of neutral matter present in the nuclei of these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately equal to one and two, respectively. This fact indicates that the nuclei of atoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a basic unit. This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick who observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were bombarded with alpha-particles (oz-particles are helium nuclei, to be discussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation could knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon and nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons (electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted of photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is available from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with a-particles. The clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to assume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral particles called neutrons. From conservation of energy and momentum, he was able to determine the mass of new particle ‘as very nearly the same as mass of proton’. The mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is mn = 1.00866 u = 1.6749X10‘27 kg (13.3) Chadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron. A free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable. It decays into a proton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and has a mean life of about 1000s. It is, however, stable inside the nucleus. The composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following terms and symbols: Z - atomic number = number of protons [13.4(a)] N - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)] A- mass number=Z+N = total number of protons and neutrons [13.4(c)] One also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the number of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A. Nuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation ‘Z‘X where X is the chemical symbol of the species. For example, the nucleus of gold is denoted by 1% Au. It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons and the restl 18 are neutrons. 2019-20",0

(b) Commonly used schematic representation of p—type material which shows only the fixed core of the substituent acceptor with one effective additional negative charge and its associated hole. semiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons become the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers. These semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type semiconductors. For n-type semiconductors, we have, 119 >>nh (ii) p-type semiconductor (14.3) This is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity like Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than Si or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with neighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to offer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth neighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as shown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice wants an electron in place of a hole, an electron in the outer orbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to ﬁll this vacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole is available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom becomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth electron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom of p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge along with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is obvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are in addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source of conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for such a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons are minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped with trivalent impurity are called p-type semiconductors. For p-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce the number (ni)of intrinsically generated electrons to ne. We have, for p-type semiconductors nh >> ne (14.4) Note that the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality as the charge of additional charge carriers is just equal and opposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice. In extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of majority current carriers, the minority carriers produced thermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and thus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of current carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly helps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers. The semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In the case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor impurities (ED) and acceptor impurities (E A) also exist. In the energy band diagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level ED is slightly below the bottom EC of the conduction band and electrons from this level move into the conduction band with very small supply of energy At room temperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~ 10‘”) atoms of Si get ionised. So the conduction band will have most electrons 476 coming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly, 2019-20",0
210,805,"BIOLOGY After getting into the body of the person, the virus enters into macrophages where RNA genome of the virus replicates to form viral DNA with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This viral DNA gets incorporated into host cell’s DNA and directs the infected cells to produce virus particles (Figure 8.6). The macrophages continue to produce virus and in this way acts like a HIV factory. Simultaneously, HIV enters into helper T—lymphocytes (TH), replicates and produce progeny viruses. The progeny Viruses released in the blood attack other helper T—lymphocytes. This is repeated leading to a progressive decrease in the number of helper T- lymphocytes in the body of the infected person. During this period, the person suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea and weight loss. Due to decrease in the number of helperT lymphocytes, the person starts suffering from infections that could have been otherwise overcome such as those due to bacteria especially Mycobacterium, viruses, fungi and even parasites like Toxoplasma The patient becomes so immuno-deﬁcient that he/ she is unable to protect himself/herself against these infections. A widely used diagnostic test for AIDS is enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment of AIDS with anti-retroviral drugs is only partially effective. They can only prolong the life of the patient but cannot prevent death, which is inevitable. Prevention of AIDS : As AIDS has no cure, prevention is the best option. Moreover, HIV infection, more often, spreads due to conscious behaviour patterns and is not something that happens inadvertently, like pneumonia or typhoid. Of course, infection in blood transfusion patients, new-borns (from mother) etc., may take place due to poor monitoring. The only excuse may be ignorance and it has been rightly said — “don’t die of ignorance”. In our country the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and other non-governmental organisation (NGOs) are doing a lot to educate people about AIDS. WHO has started a number of programmes to prevent the spreading of HIV infection. Making blood (from blood banks) safe from HIV, ensuring the use of only disposable needles and syringes in public and private hospitals and clinics, free distribution of condoms, controlling drug abuse, advocating safe sex and promoting regular check-ups for HIV in susceptible populations, are some such steps taken up. Infection with HIV or having AIDS is something that should not be hidden — since then, the infection may spread to many more people. HIV/AIDS-infected people need help and sympathy instead of being shunned by society. Unless society recognises it as a problem to be dealt with in a collective manner — the chances of wider spread of the disease increase manifold. It is a malady that can only be tackled, by the society and medical fraternity acting together, to prevent the spread of the disease. 8.4 CANCER Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of human beings and is a major cause of death all over the globe.

211,0,"UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 29 zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are signiﬁcant. Each number in this case has four significant figures. Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number a. They are always significant. (4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use the rules adopted in the preceding example : ' For a number greater than 1, without any decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not significant. ' For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero(s) are significant. (5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250) is never significant. However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement. (6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits. For example in T=E or s = 27cr, the factor 2 is an exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00 t or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in ng’ n is an exact number. 2.7. 1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with Signiﬁcant Figures The result of a calculation involving approximate measured values of quantities (i.e. values with limited number of significant ﬁgures) must reﬂect the uncertainties in the original measured values. It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be 2.5 1 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1 .6880478087 6 g/cm3 upto 1 1 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision. The following rules for arithmetic operations with signiﬁcant figures ensure that the final result of a calculation is shown with the precision that is consistent with the precision of the input measured values : (1) In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to three significant figures. 4.237g Density 2 2.51 cm 3 = 1.69 g cm'3 Similarly, if the speed of light is given as 3 x 108 m s1 (one significant figure) and one year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 x 107 s (ﬁve signiﬁcant figures), the light year is 9.47 x 1015 m (three significant figures). (2) In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise measurement (227 .2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. The final result should, therefore, be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as : 0.307 m — 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 X 10‘3 m. Note that we should not use the rule (1) applicable for multiplication and division and write 664 g as the result in the example of addition and 3.00 x 10'3 m in the example of subtraction. They do not convey the precision of measurement properly. For addition and subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal places. 2.7.2 Rounding off the Uncertain Digits The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off to three significant figures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would be 2.74. The rule by convention is that the preceding digit is raised by 1 if the 2019-20",0

213,238,"SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTA'I‘IONAL MOTION Eq. (7 .3 la) and (7 .3 lb) give six independent conditions to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of problems all the forces acting on the body are coplanar. Then we need only three conditions to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two of these conditions correspond to translational equilibrium; the sum of the components of the forces along any two perpendicular axes in the plane must be zero. The third condition corresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum of the components of the torques along any axis perpendicular to the plane of the forces must be zero. The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body may be compared with those for a particle, which we considered in earlier chapters. Since consideration of rotational motion does not apply to a particle, only the conditions for translational equilibrium (Eq. 7.30 a) apply to a particle. Thus, for equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of all the forces on it must be zero. Since all these forces act on the single particle, they must be concurrent. Equilibrium under concurrent forces was discussed in the earlier chapters. A body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it may be in translational equilibrium and not in rotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational equilibrium and not in translational equilibrium. Consider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod (AB) as shown in Fig. 7 .20(a). At the two ends (A and B) of which two parallel forces, both equal in magnitude and acting along same direction are applied perpendicular to the rod. Fig. 7.20 (a) Let C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a. the moment of the forces at A and B will both be equal in magnitude (aF), but opposite in sense as shown. The net moment on the rod will be zero. The system will be in rotational equilibrium, but it will not be in translational equilibrium; 2 F 73 0 A B C K1: Fig. 7.20 (b) The force at B in Fig. 7 .20(a) is reversed in Fig. 7 .20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with two forces of equal magnitude but acting in opposite diretions applied perpendicular to the rod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here the moments of both the forces are equal, but they are not opposite; they act in the same sense and cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod. The total force on the body is zero; so the body is in translational equilibrium; but it is not in rotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not fixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e. rotation without translation). A pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting in opposite directions with different lines of action is known as a couple or torque. A couple produces rotation without translation. When we open the lid of a bottle by turning it, our ﬁngers are applying a couple to the lid [Fig. 7.2 1(a)]. Another known example is a compass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as shown in the Fig. 7 .2 l (b). The earth’s magnetic field exerts equal forces on the north and south poles. The force on the North Pole is towards the north, and the force on the South Pole is toward the south. Except when the needle points in the north-south direction; the two forces do not have the same line of action. Thus there is a couple acting on the needle due to the earth’s magnetic field.

216,1186,"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION over-exploitation of natural resources. Many species extinctions in the last 500 years (Steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon) were due to overexploitation by humans. Presently many marine fish populations around the world are over harvested, endangering the continued existence of some commercially important species. (iii) Alien species invasions: When alien species are introduced unintentionally or deliberately for whatever purpose, some of them turn invasive, and cause decline or extinction of indigenous species. The Nile perch introduced into Lake Victoria in east Africa led eventually to the extinction of an ecologically unique assemblage of more than 200 species of cichlid ﬁsh in the lake. You must be familiar with the environmental damage caused and threat posed to our native species by invasive weed species like carrot grass (Parthenium), Lantana and water hyacinth (Eicchornia). The recent illegal introduction of the African catﬁsh Clarias gariepinus for aquaculture purposes is posing a threat to the indigenous catﬁshes in our rivers. (iv) Co-extinctions: When a species becomes extinct, the plant and animal species associated with it in an obligatory way also become extinct. When a host ﬁsh species becomes extinct, its unique assemblage of parasites also meets the same fate. Another example is the case of a coevolved plant-pollinator mutualism where extinction of one invariably leads to the extinction of the other. 15.2 BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION 15.2.1 Why Should We Conserve Biodiversity? There are many reasons, some obvious and others not so obvious, but all equally important. They can be grouped into three categories: narrowly utilitarian, broadly utilitarian, and ethical. The narrowly utilitarian arguments for conserving biodiversity are obvious; humans derive countless direct economic beneﬁts from nature- food (cereals, pulses, fruits), firewood, ﬁbre, construction material, industrial products (tannins, lubricants, dyes, resins, perfumes ) and products of medicinal importance. More than 25 per cent of the drugs currently sold in the market worldwide are derived from plants and 25,000 species of plants contribute to the traditional medicines used by native peoples around the world. Nobody knows how many more medicinally useful plants there are in tropical rain forests waiting to be explored. With increasing resources put into ‘bioprospecting’ (exploring molecular, genetic and species-level diversity for products of economic importance), — nations endowed with rich biodiversity can expect to reap enormous beneﬁts. The broadly utilitarian argument says that biodiversity plays a major role in many ecosystem services that nature provides. The fast- 2019—2020",1

220,1295,"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION community? A stable community should not show too much variation in productivity from year to year; it must be either resistant or resilient to occasional disturbances (natural or man-made), and it must also be resistant to invasions by alien species. We don’t know how these attributes are linked to species richness in a community, but David Tilman’s long-term ecosystem experiments using outdoor plots provide some tentative answers. Tilman found that plots with more species showed less year-to-year variation in total biomass. He also showed that in his experiments, increased diversity contributed to higher productivity. Although, we may not understand completely how species richness contributes to the well-being of an ecosystem, we know enough to realise that rich biodiversity is not only essential for ecosystem health but imperative for the very survival of the human race on this planet. At a time when we are losing species at an alarming pace, one might ask— Does it really matter to us if a few species become extinct? Would Western Ghats ecosystems be less functional if one of its tree frog species is lost forever? How is our quality of life affected if, say, instead of 20,000 we have only 15,000 species of ants on earth? There are no direct answers to such naive questions but we can develop a proper perspective through an analogy (the ‘rivet popper hypothesis’) used by Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich. In an airplane (ecosystem) all parts are joined together using thousands of rivets (species). If every passenger travelling in it starts popping a rivet to take home (causing a species to become extinct), it may not affect ﬂight safety (proper functioning of the ecosystem) initially, but as more and more rivets are removed, the plane becomes dangerously weak over a period of time. Furthermore, which rivet is removed may also be critical. Loss of rivets on the wings (key species that drive major ecosystem functions) is obviously a more serious threat to ﬂight safety than loss of a few rivets on the seats or windows inside the plane. 15. 1.4 Loss of Biodiversity While it is doubtful if any new species are being added (through speciation) into the earth’s treasury of species, there is no doubt about their continuing losses. The biological wealth of our planet has been declining rapidly and the accusing ﬁnger is clearly pointing to human activities. The colonisation of tropical Pacific Islands by humans is said to have led to the extinction of more than 2,000 species of native birds. The IUCN Red List (2004) documents the extinction of 784 species (including 338 vertebrates, 359 invertebrates and 87 plants) in the last 500 years. Some examples of recent extinctions include the dodo (Mauritius), quagga (Africa), thylacine (Australia), Steller’s Sea Cow (Russia) and three subspecies (Bali, Javan, Caspian) of tiger.

Anti is a Greek word that means ‘against’, and bio means ‘life’, together they mean ‘against life’ (in the context of disease causing organisms); whereas with reference to human beings, they are ‘pro life’ and not against. Antibiotics are chemical substances, which are produced by some microbes and can kill or retard the growth of other (disease-causing) microbes. You are familiar with the commonly used antibiotic Penicillin. Do you know that Penicillin was the ﬁrst antibiotic to be discovered, and it was a chance discovery? Alexander Fleming while working on Staphylococci bacteria, once observed a mould growing in one of his unwashed culture plates around which Staphylococci could not grow. He found out that it was due to a chemical produced by the mould and he named it Penicillin after the mould Penicillium notatum. However, its full potential as an effective antibiotic was established much later by Ernest Chain and Howard Florey. This antibiotic was extensively used to treat American soldiers wounded in World War II. Fleming, Chain and Florey were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945, for this discovery. 2019-2020",1

Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into speciﬁc products, individual enzymes, etc., using microbial plant, animal or human cells. A bioreactor provides the optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins, oxygen).

What would a diabetic patient do if enough human-insulin was not available? If you discuss this, you would soon realise that one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals. Would the insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as that secreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune response in the human body? Now, imagine if bacterium were available that could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes so simple.

Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber etc. which can be stretched to cause large strains are called elastomers. 9.6 ELASTIC MODULI The proportional region within the elastic limit of the stress-strain curve (region 0A in Fig. 9.3) is of great importance for structural and manufacturing engineering designs. The ratio of stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity, is found to be a characteristic of the material. 9.6. 1 Young’s Modulus Experimental observation show that for a given material, the magnitude of the strain produced is same whether the stress is tensile or compressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive) stress (a) to the longitudinal strain (6) is deﬁned as Young’s modulus and is denoted by the symbol Y. O' Y= E (9.7) From Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2), we have Y= (F/AJ/(AL/L) = (Fx L) /(A x AL) (9.8) Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the unit of Young’s modulus is the same as that of stress i.e., N m—2 or Pascal (Pa). Table 9.1 gives the values of Young’s moduli and yield strengths of some material. From the data given in Table 9. 1, it is noticed that for metals Young’s moduli are large. Therefore, these materials require a large force to produce small change in length. To increase the length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm2 cross- sectional area by 0.1%, a force of 2000 N is required. The force required to produce the same strain in aluminium, brass and copper wires having the same cross-sectional area are 690 N, 900 N and 1 100 N respectively.

Here we just describe the behaviour of the wavefronts as they undergo reﬂection or refraction. In Fig. 10.7(a) we consider a plane wave passing through a thin prism. Clearly, since the speed of light waves is less in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront (which travels through the greatest thickness of glass) will get delayed resulting in a tilt in the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure. In Fig. l 0.7(b) we consider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens; the central part of the incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is delayed the most. The emerging wavefront has a depression at the centre and therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point F which is known as the focus. In Fig. 10.7(c) a plane wave is incident on a concave mirror and on reﬂection we have a spherical wave converging to the focal point F. In a similar manner, we can understand refraction and reﬂection by concave lenses and convex mirrors.

(b) a convex lens. (c) Reﬂection of a 358 plane wave by a concave mirror. From the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a point on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same measured along any ray. For example, when a convex lens focusses light to form a real image, although the ray going through the centre traverses a shorter path, but because of the slower speed in glass, the time taken is the same as for rays travelling near the edge of the lens. 10.3.4 The doppler effect We should mention here that one should be careful in constructing the wavefronts if the source (or the observer) is moving. For example, if there is no medium and the source moves away from the observer, then later wavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer and hence take a longer time. The time taken between the arrival of two successive wavefronts is hence longer at the observer than it is at the source. Thus, when the source moves away from the observer the frequency as measured by the source will be smaller. This is known as the Doppler effect. Astronomers call the increase in wavelength due to doppler effect as red shift since a wavelength in the middle of the visible region of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum. When waves are received from a source moving towards the observer, there is an apparent decrease in wavelength, this is referred to as blue shift. 2019-20",0

228,881,"BIOLOGY Smoking also paves the way to hard drugs. Tobacco has been used by human beings for more than 400 years. It is smoked, chewed or used as a snuff. Tobacco contains a large number of chemical substances including nicotine, an alkaloid. Nicotine stimulates adrenal gland to release adrenaline and nor-adrenaline into blood circulation, both of which raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. Smoking is associated with increased incidence of cancers of lung, urinary bladder and throat, bronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart disease, gastric ulcer, etc. Tobacco chewing is associated with increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity. Smoking increases carbon monoxide (CO) content in blood and reduces the concentration of haembound oxygen. This causes oxygen deﬁciency in the body. When one buys packets of cigarettes one cannot miss the statutory warning that is present on the packing which warns against smoking and says how it is injurious to health. Yet, smoking is very prevalent in society, both among young and old. Knowing the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and its addictive nature, the youth and old need to avoid these habits. Any addict requires counselling and medical help to get rid of the habit. 8.5. 1 Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol Abuse Adolescence means both ‘a period’ and ‘a process’ during which a child becomes mature in terms of his / her attitudes and beliefs for effective participation in society. The period between 12- 18 years of age may be thought of as adolescence period. In other words, adolescence is a bridge linking childhood and adulthood. Adolescence is accompanied by several biological and behavioural changes. Adolescence, thus is a very vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an individual. Curiosity, need for adventure and excitement, and experimentation, constitute common causes, which motivate youngsters towards drug and alcohol use. A child’s natural curiosity motivates him / her to experiment. This is complicated further by effects that might be perceived as beneﬁts, of alcohol or drug use. Thus, the first use of drugs or alcohol may be out of curiosity or experimentation, but later the child starts using these to escape facing problems. Of late, stress, from pressures to excel in academics or examinations, has played a significant role in persuading the youngsters to try alcohol and drugs. The perception among youth that it is ‘cool’ or progressive to smoke, use drugs or alcohol, is also in a way a major cause for youth to start these habits. Television, movies, newspapers, internet also help to promote this perception. Other factors that have been seen to be associated with drug and alcohol abuse among adolescents are unstable or unsupportive family structures and peer pressure. 2019—2020",1

Ubiquinone also receives reducing equivalents via FADH2 (complex II) that is generated during oxidation of succinate in the citric acid cycle. The reduced ubiquinone (ubiquinol) is then oxidised with the transfer of electrons to cytochrome 0 via cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III). Cytochrome c is a small protein attached to the outer surface of the inner membrane and acts as a mobile carrier for transfer of electrons between complex III and IV. Complex IV refers to cytochrome c oxidase complex containing cytochromes a and a3, and two copper centres. When the electrons pass from one carrier to another via complex I to IV in the electron transport chain, they are coupled to ATP synthase (complex V) for the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The number of ATP molecules synthesised depends on the nature of the electron donor. Oxidation of one molecule of NADH gives rise to 3 molecules of ATP, While that of one molecule of FADH2 produces 2 molecules of ATP.

231,772,"CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION 333 22.2.2 The Pituitary Gland Hypothalamus Hypothalamic The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity ‘ neurons called sella tursica and is attached to hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is divided anatomically into an adenohypophysis and a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysis consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary, commonly called anterior pituitary, produces growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle Portal circulation stimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermedia Posterior secretes only one hormone called melanocyte 'i 7 pimitary stimulating hormone (MSH). However, in humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged Anterior with pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars pituitary nervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores Figure 22.2 Diagrammatic representation of and releases two hormones called oxytocin and pituitary and its rekﬁ‘ﬁOUShiP With hypothalamus vasopressin, which are actually synthesised by the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis. Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarﬁsm. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults especially in middle age can result in severe disﬁgurement (especially of the face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications, and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes in external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal activity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis. In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graaﬁan follicles) and maintains the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graaﬁan follicles",1

These smaller DNA are called (about 0.1 “ml plasmids. The plasmid DNA confers certain unique phenotypic characters to such bacteria. One such character is resistance to antibiotics.

No organelles, like the ones in eukaryotic cell with other eukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells except organisms for ribosomes. Prokaryotes have something unique in the form of inclusions. A specialised differentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristic of prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane. 8.4. 1 Cell Envelope and its Modiﬁcations Most prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically complex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three layered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and then the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs distinct function, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can be classiﬁed into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes and the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed by Gram viz. those that take up the gram stain are Gram positive and the others that do not are called Gram negative bacteria. Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different bacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the slime layer in some, while in others it may be thick and tough, called the capsule. The cell wall determines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interacts with the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of the eukaryotes. A special membranous structure is the mesosome which is formed by the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. ’Ihese extensions are in the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae.

234,398,"l Physics 9.7 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA DUE TO SUNLIGHT The Interplay of light with things around us gives rise to several beautiful phenomena. The spectacles of colours that we see around us all the time is possible due to sunlight. While studying dispersion of visible (or white) light by a prism (Class X) and the electromagnetic spectrum (Chapter 8, Class XII), we got to know that colour is associated with the frequency of light or the wavelength of light in the given medium. In the visible spectrum, red light is at the long wavelength end (~ 700 nm) while the violet light is at the short wavelength end (~ 400 nm). Dispersion takes place because the refractive index of medium for different frequencies (colours) is different. For example, the bending of red component of white light is least while it is most for the violet. Equivalently, red light travels faster than Violet light in a glass prism. Table 9.2 gives the refractive indices for different wavelength for crown glass and ﬂint glass. Thick lenses could be assumed as made of many prisms, therefore, thick lenses show chromatic aberration due to dispersion of light. When white light passes through thick lenses, red and blue colours focus at different points. This phenomenon is known as chromatic aberration. TABLE 9.2 REFRACTIVE INDICES FOR DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS Violet Blue Yellow Red 332 396.9 1.533 1.663 486.1 1.523 1.639 589.3 1.517 1.627 656.3 1.515 1.622 The variation of refractive index with wavelength may be more pronounced in some media than the other. In vacuum, of course, the speed of light is independent of wavelength. Thus, vacuum (or air approximately) is a non-dispersive medium in which all colours travel with the same speed. This also follows from the fact that sunlight reaches us in the form of white light and not as its components. On the other hand, glass is a dispersive medium. The blue of the sky, white clouds, the red-hue at sunrise and sunset, the rainbow, the brilliant colours of some pearls, shells, and wings of birds, are just a few of the natural wonders we are used to. We describe some of them here from the point of view of physics. 2019-20",0
235,1033,"154 BioquY 9. 12 ENZYMES Almost all enzymes are proteins. There are some nucleic acids that behave like enzymes. These are called ribozymes. One can depict an enzyme by a line diagram. An enzyme like any protein has a primary structure, i.e., amino acid sequence of the protein. An enzyme like any protein has the secondary and the tertiary structure. When you look at a tertiary structure (Figure 9.4 b) you will notice that the backbone of the protein chain folds upon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or pockets are made. One such pocket is the ‘active site’. An active site of an enzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes, through their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts differ from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference needs mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures and high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures (say above 40°C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally live under extremely high temperatures (e. g., hot vents and sulphur springs), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high temperatures (upto 80°—90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important quality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms. 9. 12. 1 Chemical Reactions How do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical reaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical change simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds. This is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state of matter: when ice melts into water, or when water becomes a vapour. These are also physical processes. However, when bonds are broken and new bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical reaction. For example: Ba(OH)2 + H2804 —> BaSO4 + 2H2O is an inorganic chemical reaction. Similarly, hydrolysis of starch into glucose is an organic chemical reaction. Rate of a physical or chemical process refers to the amount of product formed per unit time. It can be expressed as: 6 P rate — — 6: Rate can also be called velocity if the direction is specified. Rates of physical and chemical processes are inﬂuenced by temperature among other factors. A general rule of thumb is that rate doubles or decreases by half 2019-2020",1

Sewage from our homes as well as from hospitals are likely to contain many undesirable pathogenic micro- organisms, and its disposal into a water without proper treatment may cause outbreak of serious diseases, such as, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice, cholera, etc. Unlike domestic sewage, waste water from industries like petroleum, paper manufacturing, metal extraction and processing, chemical manufacturing, etc., often contain toxic substances, notably, heavy metals (defined as elements with density > 5 g/cm3 such as mercury, cadmium, copper, lead, etc.) and a variety of organic compounds. A few toxic substances, often present in industrial waste waters, can undergo biological magnification (Biomagnification) in the aquatic food chain. Biomagniﬁcation refers to increase in concentration of the toxicant at successive trophic levels. This happens Zooplankton because a toxic substance accumulated by an organism (DDT 0.04 ppm) cannot be metabolised or excreted, and is thus passed on to the next higher trophic level. This phenomenon is well- known for mercury and DDT. Figure 1 6.5 shows biomagniﬁcation of DDT in an aquatic food chain. In this manner, the concentration of DDT is increased at Water successive trophic levels; say if it starts at 0.003 ppb (ppb = parts per billion) in water, it can ultimately reach 25 ppm (ppm = parts per million) in ﬁsh-eating birds, through biomagniﬁcation.

As the lake’s fertility increases, plant 2 7 6 and animal life burgeons, and organic remains begin to be deposited on the lake bottom. Over the centuries, as silt and organic debris pile up, the lake grows shallower and warmer, with warm-water organisms supplanting those that thrive in a cold environment. Marsh plants take root in the shallows and begin to ﬁll in the original lake basin. Eventually, the lake gives way to large masses of ﬂoating plants (bog), ﬁnally converting into land.

Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors inﬂuencing population density, the other two factors assuming importance only under special conditions. For instance, if a new habitat is just being colonised, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates. Growth Models : Does the growth of a population with time show any specific and predictable pattern? We have been concerned about unbridled human population growth and problems created by it in our countIy and it is therefore natural for us to be curious if different animal populations in nature behave the same way or show some restraints on growth. Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from nature on how to control population growth. (1) Exponential growth: Resource (food and space) availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population.

Some of these land reptiles went back into water to evolve into ﬁsh like reptiles probably 200 mya (e.g. Ichthyosaurs). The land reptiles were, of course, the dinosaurs. The biggest of them, i.e., Tyrannosaurus rex was about 20 feet in height and had huge fearsome dagger like teeth. About 65 mya, the dinosaurs suddenly disappeared from the earth. We do not know the true reason. Some say climatic changes killed them. Some say most of them evolved into birds. The truth may live in between. Small sized reptiles of that era still exist today. The ﬁrst mammals were like shrews. Their fossils are small sized. Mammals were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the mother’s body. Mammals were more intelligent in sensing and avoiding danger at least. When reptiles came down mammals took over this earth. There were in South America mammals resembling horse, hippopotamus, bear, rabbit, etc. Due to continental drift, when South America joined North America, these animals were overridden by North American fauna. Due to the same continental drift pouched mammals of Australia survived because of lack of competition from any other mammal. Lest we forget, some mammals live wholly in water. Whales, dolphins, seals and sea cows are some examples. Evolution of horse, elephant, dog, etc., are special stories of evolution. You will learn about these in higher classes. The most successful story is the evolution of man with language skills and self-consciousness. A rough sketch of the evolution of life forms, their times on a geological scale are indicated in (Figure 7 .9 and 7.10). 7.9 ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF MAN About 15 mya, primates called Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus were existing. They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees. Ramapithecus was more man-like while Dryopithecus was more ape-like. Few fossils of man-like bones have been discovered in Ethiopia and Tanzania (Figure 7.1 1). These revealed hominid features leading to the belief that about 3-4 mya, man-like primates walked in eastern Africa. They were probably not taller than 4 feet but walked up right. Two mya, Australopithecines probably lived in East African grasslands. Evidence shows they hunted with stone weapons but essentially ate fruit. Some of the bones among the bones discovered were different. This creature was called the ﬁrst human-like being the hominid and was called Homo habilis. The brain capacities were between 650-800cc. They probably did not eat meat. Fossils discovered in Java in 1891 revealed the next stage, i.e., Homo erectus about 1.5 mya. Homo erectus had a large brain around 90000. 2019—2020",1

243,1446,"118 Tides of Bay of Fundy, Canada The highest tides in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, Canada. The tidal bulge is 15 - 16 m. Because there are two high tides and two low tides every day (roughly a 24 hour period); then a tide must come in within about a six hour period. As a rough estimate, the tide rises about 240 cm an hour (1,440 cm divided by 6 hours). If you have walked down a beach with a steep cliff alongside (which is common there), make sure you watch the tides. If you walk for about an hour and then notice that the tide is coming in, the water will be over your head before you get back to where you started! Types of Tides Tides vary in their frequency, direction and movement from place to place and also from time to time. Tides may be grouped into various types based on their frequency of occurrence in one day or 24 hours or based on their height. Tides based on Frequency Semi-diurnal tide : The most common tidal pattern, featuring two high tides and two low tides each day. The successive high or low tides are approximately of the same height. Diurnal tide :There is only one high tide and one low tide during each day. The successive high and low tides are approximately of the same height. Mixed tide :Tides having variations in height are known as mixed tides. These tides generally occur along the west coast of North America and on many islands of the Paciﬁc Ocean. Tides based on the Sun, Moon and the Earth Positions The height of rising water (high tide) varies appreciably depending upon the position of sun and moon with respect to the earth. Spring tides and neap tides come under this category. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Spring tides : The position of both the sun and the moon in relation to the earth has direct bearing on tide height. When the sun, the moon and the earth are in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher. These are called spring tides and they occur twice a month, one on full moon period and another during new moon period. Neap tides : Normally, there is a seven day interval between the spring tides and neap tides. At this time the sun and moon are at right angles to each other and the forces of the sun and moon tend to counteract one another. The Moon’s attraction, though more than twice as strong as the sun’s, is diminished by the counteracting force of the sun’s gravitational pull. Once in a month, when the moon’s orbit is closest to the earth (perigee), unusually high and low tides occur. During this time the tidal range is greater than normal. ’Rvo weeks later, when the moon is farthest from earth (apogee), the moon’s gravitational force is limited and the tidal ranges are less than their average heights. When the earth is closest to the sun (perihelion), around 3rd January each year, tidal ranges are also much greater, with unusually high and unusually low tides. When the earth is farthest from the sun (aphelion), around 4th July each year, tidal ranges are much less than average. The time between the high tide and low tide, when the water level is falling, is called the ebb. The time between the low tide and high tide, when the tide is rising, is called the ﬂow or ﬂood. Importance of Tides Since tides are caused by the earth-moon-sun positions which are known accurately, the tides can be predicted well in advance. This helps the navigators and ﬁshermen plan their activities. Tidal ﬂows are of great importance in navigation. Tidal heights are very important, especially harbours near rivers and within estuaries having shallow ‘bars’ at the entrance, which prevent ships and boats from entering into the harbour.

Hence, in addition to conventional practices of animal breeding and care, newer technologies also have to be applied to achieve improvement in quality and productivity. 9. 1. 1 Management of Farms and Farm Animals A professional approach to what have been traditional practices of farm management gives the much needed boost to our food production. Let us discuss some of the management procedures, employed in various animal farm systems. 9. 1. 1.1 Dairy Farm Management Dairying is the management of animals for milk and its products for human consumption. Can you list the animals that you would expect to ﬁnd in a dairy? What are different kinds of products that can be made with milk from a dairy farm? In dairy farm management, we deal with processes and systems that increase yield and improve quality of milk. Milk yield is primarily dependent on the quality of breeds in the farm. Selection of good breeds having high yielding potential (under the climatic conditions of the area), combined with resistance to diseases is very important. For the yield potential to be realised the cattle have to be well looked after — they have to be housed well, should have adequate water and be maintained disease free. The feeding of cattle should be carried out in a scientiﬁc manner — with special emphasis on the quality and quantity of fodder. Besides, stringent cleanliness and hygiene (both of the cattle and the handlers) are of paramount importance while milking, storage and transport of the milk and its products. Nowadays, of course, much of these processes have become mechanised, which reduces chance of direct contact of the produce with the handler. Ensuring these stringent measures would of course, require regular inspections, with proper record keeping. It would also help to identify and rectify the problems as early as possible. Regular visits by a veterinary doctor would be mandatory. You would probably find it interesting if you were to prepare a questionnaire on diverse aspects of dairy keeping and then follow it up with a Visit to a dairy farm in your locality and seek answers to the questions. 9.1.1.2 Poultry Farm Management Poultry is the class of domesticated fowl (birds) used for food or for their eggs. They typically include chicken and ducks, and sometimes turkey and geese. The word poultry is often used to refer to the meat of only these birds, but in a more general sense it may refer to the meat of other birds too. As in dairy farming, selection of disease free and suitable breeds, proper and safe farm conditions, proper feed and water, and hygiene and health care are important components of poultry farm management. 2019—2020",1

For example, Fig. 10.8(a) describes a laminar ﬂow where the velocities at different points in the fluid may have different magnitudes but their directions are parallel. Figure 10.8 (b) gives a sketch of turbulent ﬂow. (a) (b) Fig. 10.8 (a) Some streamlines for ﬂuid ﬂow. (b) A jet of air striking a ﬂat plate placed perpendicular to it. This is an example of turbulent ﬂow. 10.4 BERNOULLI'S PRINCIPLE Fluid ﬂow is a complex phenomenon. But we can obtain some useful properties for steady or streamline ﬂows using the conservation of energy. Consider a ﬂuid moving in a pipe of varying cross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying heights as shown in Fig. 10.9. We now suppose that an incompressible ﬂuid is ﬂowing through the pipe in a steady ﬂow. Its velocity must change as a consequence of equation of continuity. A force is required to produce this acceleration, which is caused by the ﬂuid surrounding it, the pressure must be different in different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a general expression that relates the pressure difference between two points in a pipe to both velocity changes (kinetic energy change) and elevation (height) changes (potential energy Daniel Bernoulli (1 700 —1 782) change). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli developed this relationship in 1738. Consider the ﬂow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC) and 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the ﬂuid initially lying between B and D. In an infinitesimal time interval At, this ﬂuid would have moved. Suppose U1 is the speed at B and v2 at D, then ﬂuid initially at B has moved a distance let to C (let is small enough to assume constant cross-section along BC). In the same interval At the ﬂuid initially at D moves to E, a distance equal to v2At. Pressures P1 and P2 act as shown on the plane faces of areas A1 and A2 binding the two regions. The work done on the ﬂuid at left end (BC) is W1 = P1A1(v1At) = PIAV. Since the same volume AV passes through both the regions (from the equation of continuity) the work done by the ﬂuid at the other end (DE) is W2 = P2A2(v2At) = P2AVor, the work done on the ﬂuid is —P2AV. So the total work done on the ﬂuid is W1 — W2 = (Pl—P2) AV Part of this work goes into changing the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid, and part goes into changing the gravitational potential energy. If the density of the ﬂuid is p and Am = pAllet = pAV is the mass passing through the pipe in time At, then change in gravitational potential energy is AU = pgAV (hZ—hl) The change in its kinetic energy is AK = p AV (1122—012) We can employ the work — energy theorem (Chapter 6) to this volume of the ﬂuid and this yields 1 (Pl—P2) AV= (E) p AV(v22 —v12) + pgAV (h2—h1) We now divide each term by AVto obtain 1 (Ia—P2) = [5) P (vi-v.21 + pg (re—h.)

249,341,"108 PHYSICS — In simple terms, the law can be stated thus : Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies. Force on a body A by body B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A. Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces. There is no cause-effect relation between action and reaction. Any of the two mutual forces can be called action and the other reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out. The internal action and reaction forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero. 7. Law of Conservation ofMomentum The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved. The law follows from the second and third law of motion. 8. Friction Frictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It is the component of the contact force along the common tangent to the surface in contact. Static friction fS opposes impending relative motion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent of the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws : fs S (fslmaX = :usR f k = ”kR us (co—efficient of static friction) and uk [co-efficient of kinetic friction) are constants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.

Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of the body at that time. Force is not 'carried' by the body from its earlier history of motion. The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train. there is no horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding air are neglected. The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity. 4. In the second law of motion F = m a.

250,823,"78 BIOLOGY Do you realise that the example of ABO blood grouping also provides a good example of multiple alleles? Here you can see that there are more than two, i.e., three alleles, governing the same character. Since in an individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found only when population studies are made. Occasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect. For example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It has two alleles (B and b). Starch is synthesised effectively by BB homozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast, bb homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce smaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, BB seeds are round and the bb seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and so B seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are of intermediate size in Bb seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as the phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete dominance. Therefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the product that it has information for. It depends as much on the gene product and the production of a particular phenotype from this product as it does on the particular phenotype that we choose to examine, in case more than one phenotype is inﬂuenced by the same gene. 5.3 INHERITANCE OF Two GENES Mendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two characters, as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with yellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour and wrinkled shape (Figure5.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting from the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped seeds. Here can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow/ green colour and round/ wrinkled shape was dominant? Thus, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape dominant over wrinkled. These results were identical to those that he got when he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and green seeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants. Let us use the genotypic symbols Y for dominant yellow seed colour and y for recessive green seed colour, R for round shaped seeds and r for wrinkled seed shape. The genotype of the parents can then be written as RRYY and rryy. The cross between the two plants can be written down as in Figure 5.7 showing the genotypes of the parent plants. The gametes RY and ry unite on fertilisation to produce the F1 hybrid RrYy. When Mendel self hybridised the F1 plants he found that 3/4th of F2 plants had yellow seeds and 1 /4th had green. The yellow and green colour segregated in a 3:1 ratio. Round and wrinkled seed shape also segregated in a 3: 1 ratio; just like in a monohybrid cross. 2019-2020",1
251,1352,"SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS varieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start dividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. In such species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more than one embryo in a seed is referred to as polyembryony. Take out some seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of dijferent sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos in each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos? Can they be called clones? Hybrid varieties of several of our food and vegetable crops are being extensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased productivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have to be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown, the plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid characters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of hybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If these hybrids are made into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid progeny. Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise new crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every year. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry, active research is going on in many laboratories around the world to understand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes into hybrid varieties. SUMMARY Flowers are the seat of sexual reproduction in angiosperms. In the ﬂower, androecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive organs and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female reproductive organs. A typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate. Pollen grains develop inside the microsporangia. Four wall layers, the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the microsporangium. Cells of the sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of the microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form tetrads of microspores. Individual microspores mature into pollen grains. Pollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation. The pollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine. The exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores. Pollen grains may have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a vegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding. The pistil has three parts — the stigma, style and the ovary. Ovules are present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective integument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is the nueellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the archesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of the megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The mature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate.

Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents. Humans knew from as early as 8000- 1000 B.C. that one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual reproduction.

Liquids and gases can ﬂow and are therefore, called ﬂuids. It is this property that distinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way. Fluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of air and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water. Water is not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian body constitute mostly of water. All the processes occurring in living beings including plants are mediated by ﬂuids. Thus understanding the behaviour and properties of ﬂuids is important. How are ﬂuids different from solids? What is common in liquids and gases? Unlike a solid, a ﬂuid has no definite shape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume, whereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We have learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids can be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas depends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we talk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume under atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases and solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change in volume due to change of external pressure is rather small. In other words solids and liquids have much lower compressibility as compared to gases. Shear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its volume fixed. The key property of ﬂuids is that they offer very little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by application of very small shear stress. The shearing stress of ﬂuids is about million times smaller than that of solids. 10.2 PRESSURE A sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it.

260,822,"BIOMOLECULES 9. 10 METABOLIC BASIS FOR LIVING Metabolic pathways can lead to a more complex structure from a simpler structure (for example, acetic acid becomes cholesterol) or lead to a simpler structure from a complex structure (for example, glucose becomes lactic acid in our skeletal muscle). The former cases are called biosynthetic pathways or anabolic pathways. The latter constitute degradation and hence are called catabolic pathways. Anabolic pathways, as expected, consume energy. Assembly of a protein from amino acids requires energy input. On the other hand, catabolic pathways lead to the release of energy. For example, when glucose is degraded to lactic acid in our skeletal muscle, energy is liberated. This metabolic pathway from glucose to lactic acid which occurs in 10 metabolic steps is called glycolysis. Living organisms have learnt to trap this energy liberated during degradation and store it in the form of chemical bonds. As and when needed, this bond energy is utilised for biosynthetic, osmotic and mechanical work that we perform. The most important form of energy currency in living systems is the bond energi in a chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). How do living organisms derive their energy? What strategies have they evolved? How do they store this energy and in what form? How do they convert this energy into work? You will study and understand all this under a sub-discipline called ‘Bioenergetics’ later in your higher classes. 9. 1 1 THE LIVING STATE At this level, you must understand that the tens and thousands of chemical compounds in a living organism, otherwise called metabolites, or biomolecules, are present at concentrations characteristic of each of them. For example, the blood concentration of glucose in a normal healthy individual is 4.2 mmol/L—6. 1 mmol/ L, while that of hormones would be nanograms/mL. The most important fact of biological systems is that all living organisms exist in a steady-state characterised by concentrations of each of these biomolecules. These biomolecules are in a metabolic ﬂux. Any chemical or physical process moves spontaneously to equilibrium. The steady state is a non-equilibrium state. One should remember from physics that systems at equilibrium cannot perform work. As living organisms work continuously, they cannot afford to reach equilibrium. Hence the living state is a non-equilibrium steady- state to be able to perform work; living process is a constant effort to prevent falling into equilibrium. This is achieved by energy input. Metabolism provides a mechanism for the production of energy. Hence the living state and metabolism are synonymous. Without metabolism there cannot be a living state. 153",1

The second meiotic division is also unequal and results in the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon the haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to form a diploid zygote. How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote? One has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this stage itself. Let us see how‘? As you know the chromosome pattern in the human female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid gametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome thereas in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y, hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per cent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carryingXXwould develop into a female baby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal patterns in Chapter 5). That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother! The mitotic division starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus of the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus (Figure 3.1 1) and forms 2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres.

An object that is in ﬂight after being thrown or projected is called a projectile. Such a projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a baseball or any other object. The motion of a projectile may be thought of as the result of two separate, simultaneously occurring components of motions. One component is along a horizontal direction without any acceleration and the other along the vertical direction with constant acceleration due to the force of gravity. It was Galileo who first stated this independency of the horizontal and the vertical components of projectile motion in his Dialogue on the great world systems (1632). In our discussion, we shall assume that the air resistance has negligible effect on the motion of the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is launched with velocity v0 that makes an angle 00 with the x—aXis as shown in Fig. 4.17. After the object has been projected, the acceleration acting on it is that due to gravity which is directed vertically downward: a = -gJ' Or, ax = O, ay = — g (4.36) The components of initial velocity v0 are : 1)”: v0 cos 00 Day: vO sin 00 (4.37) O :evo cos 60%- x Fig 4. 1 7 Motion of an object prcy’ected with velocity v0 at angle 00. If we take the initial position to be the origin of the reference frame as shown in Fig. 4.17, we have : X0: 0, y0 = 0 Then, Eq.(4.34b) becomes : x= voxt= (vo cos 60) t and y = (v, Sin 0,) t—(1/2)th (4.38) The components of velocity at time t can be obtained using Eq.(4.33b) : v=v =vcos0 OX 0 0 vy = v0 sin 00 — g t (4.39) Equation (4.38) gives the x—, and y-coordinates of the position of a projectile at time tin terms of two parameters — initial speed v0 and projection angle 00. Notice that the choice of mutually perpendicular x—, and y-directions for the analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in a simplification. One of the components of velocity, i.e. x—component remains constant throughout the motion and only the y- component changes, like an object in free fall in vertical direction. This is shown graphically at few instants in Fig. 4. 18. Note that at the point of maximum height, vy= O and therefore, v 6=tan‘1—y=0 vx Equation ofpath ofa projectile What is the shape of the path followed by the projectile?

264,1254,"EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION in the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helps in an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby concentrating the ﬁltrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly four times concentrated than the initial ﬁltrate formed. 19.5 REGULATION OF KIDNEY FUNCTION The functioning of the kidneys is efﬁciently monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, J GA and to a certain extent, the heart. Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume, body ﬂuid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of ﬂuid from the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body ﬂuid volume can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood ﬂow and thereby the GFR. The J GA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood ﬂow/glomerular blood pressure / GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin 11, being a powerful vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na’“ and water from the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as the Renin-Angiotensin mechanism. An increase in blood ﬂow to the atria of the heart can cause the release of Atrial Natriuretic Factor (AN F). AN F can cause vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. AN F mechanism, therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism. 19.6 MICTURITION Urine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder where it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervous system (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder as it gets ﬁlled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the walls of the bladder send signals to the CNS. ’Ihe CNS passes on motor messages",1

Both B and T lymphocytes are responsible for immune responses of the body. Platelets also called thrombocytes, are cell fragments produced from megakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally contains 1 ,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm*3. Platelets can release avariety of substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of blood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which will lead to excessive loss of blood from the body. 18. 1 .3 Blood Groups As you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it appears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done. Two such groupings — the ABC and Rh — are widely used all over the world. 18.1.3.1 ABO grouping ABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens (chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A and B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural antibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution of antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood, A. B, AB and O are given in Table l 8. 1. You probably know that during blood transfusion, any blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched with the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe problems of clumping (destruction of RBC). The donor’s compatibility is also shown in the Table 18.1.

267,208,"Moving Chorges and Magnetism equilibrium is a stable one. Any small rotation of the coil produces a torque which brings it back to its original position. When they are antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces a torque which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of this torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole aligns itself with the external magnetic ﬁeld. If the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.

You have already learnt about some of them, e. g., rectilinear motion and motion of a projectile. Both these motions are non-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular motion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In these cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of time, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have enjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both these motions are repetitive in nature but different from the periodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro about a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes a similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro motion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the piston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a motion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we study this motion. The study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its concepts are required for the understanding of many physical phenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar or the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce pleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms in telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about their mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make the propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate about their equilibrium positions, the average energi of vibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power supply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive and negative about the mean value (zero). The description of a periodic motion, in general, and oscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental concepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude and phase. These concepts are developed in the next section. 2019-20",0
269,40,"Moving Charges and Magnetism Fm = 1b LBa I I = ﬂ; wad” L (4.23) It is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. From considerations similar to above we can ﬁnd the force Fab, on a segment of length L of ‘a’ due to the current in ‘b’. It is equal in magnitude to Fba, and directed towards ‘b’. Thus, Fba = —Fab (4 ' 24) Note that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for parallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the Biot—Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with Newton’s third Law*. We have seen from above that currents ﬂowing in the same direction attract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel each other. Thus, Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel. This rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same sign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each other. Let jga represent the magnitude of the force Fba per unit length. Then, from Eq. (4.23), #01 a1 b fba _ 2 1: d The above expression is used to deﬁne the ampere (A), which is one of the seven SI base units. The ampere is the value of that steady current which, when maintained in each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce on each of these conductors a force equal to 2 X 10‘7 newtons per metre of length. This deﬁnition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical definition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth’s magnetic field and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate geometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure this mechanical force. The SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in terms of the ampere. When a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of charge that ﬂows through its cross-section in ls is one coulomb (10). (4.25) * It turns out that when we have time—dependent currents and/ or charges in motion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/ or conductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics is conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even for the case of time—dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided the momentum carried by fields is also taken into account. 155 2019-20",0
270,1012,"284 BIOLOGY pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the ﬂow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward ﬂow. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 18.2). A patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino—atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio—ventricular septum called the atria-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal ﬁbres, atrio- ventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the inter- ventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute ﬁbres throughout the ventricular musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje ﬁbres. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 7 0-7 5 min—1, and is responsible for initiating and maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 7 O- 75 times in a minute (average 72 beats min—1). 18.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava ﬂows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction — the atrial systole. This increases the ﬂow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract, (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation (diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and",1

272,1697,"238 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements 6.5.1 Cash from Operating Activities Operating activities are the activities that constitute the primary or main activities of an enterprise. For example, for a company manufacturing garments, operating activities are procurement of raw material, incurrence of manufacturing expenses, sale of garments, etc. These are the principal revenue generating activities (or the main activities) of the enterprise and these activities are not investing or ﬁnancing activities. The amount of cash from operations' indicates the internal solvency level of the company, and is regarded as the key indicator of the extent to which the operations of the enterprise have generated sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to maintain the operating capability of the enterprise, paying dividends, making of new investments and repaying of loans without recourse to external source of ﬁnancing. Cash ﬂows from operating activities are primarily derived from the main activities of the enterprise. They generally result from the transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net profit or loss. Examples of cash ﬂows from operating activities are: Cash Inﬂows from operating activities 0 cash receipts from sale of goods and the rendering of services. 0 cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenues. Cash Outﬂows from operating activities 0 Cash payments to suppliers for goods and services. Cash payments to and on behalf of the employees. 0 Cash payments to an insurance enterprise for premiums and claims, annuities, and other policy beneﬁts. 0 Cash payments of income taxes unless they can be speciﬁcally identiﬁed with ﬁnancing and investing activities.

We know that the translational motion of a system of particles is the motion of its centre of mass. Fig. 7.37 The rolling motion (without slipping) of a disc on a level surface. Note at any instant, the point of contact P0 of the disc with the surface is at rest; the centre of mass of the disc moves with velocity, vcm. The disc rotates with angular velocity 6:; about its axis which passes through C; vcm =Rw, where R is the radius of the disc. Let ch be the velocity of the centre of mass and therefore the translational velocity of the disc. Since the centre of mass of the rolling disc is at its geometric centre C (Fig. 7. 37), vcm is the velocity of C. It is parallel to the level surface. The rotational motion of the disc is about its symmetry axis, which passes through C. Thus, the velocity of any point of the disc, like P0, P1 or P2, consists of two parts, one is the translational velocity ch and the other is the linear velocity vr on account of rotation. The magnitude of VT is Dr: M), where wis the angular velocity of the rotation of the disc about the axis and r is the distance of the point from the axis (i.e. from C). The velocity vr is directed perpendicular to the radius vector of the given point with respect to C.

Thus for the disc the condition for rolling without slipping is vcm = R0) (7.47) Incidentally, this means that the velocity of point P1 at the top of the disc (v1) has a magnitude vcm+ Ra) or 2 v6m and is directed parallel to the level surface. The condition (7 .47) applies to all rolling bodies. 7.14. 1 Kinetic Energy of Rolling Motion Our next task will be to obtain an expression for the kinetic energy of a rolling body. The kinetic energy of a rolling body can be separated into kinetic energy of translation and kinetic energy of rotation. This is a special case of a general result for a system of particles, according to which the kinetic energy of a system of particles (K) can be separated into the kinetic energy of translational motion of the centre of mass (MW/2) and kinetic energy of rotational motion about the centre of mass of the system of particles (K’). Thus, K=K’+ MV2 /2 (7.48) We assume this general result (see Exercise 7.3 1), and apply it to the case of rolling motion. In our notation, the kinetic energy of the centre of mass, i.e., the kinetic energy of translation, of the rolling body is mvzcm / 2, where m is the mass of the body and vcm is the centre of the mass velocity. Since the motion of the rolling body about the centre of mass is rotation, K’ represents the kinetic energy of rotation of the body; K’=I(o2/2 , where I is the moment of inertia about the appropriate axis, which is the symmetry axis of the rolling body. The kinetic energy of a rolling body, therefore, is given by 1 2 1 2 K:— 10) + —m1) 2 2 cm (7.493) Substituting I = mk2 where k = the corresponding radius of gyration of the body and um: R 03, we get 1 k2 or K = 5m03m[1+—] (7.4913)",0

This description is mainly of gross structural features, both external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable living phenomena were also recorded as part of this description. Before experimental biology or more speciﬁcally, physiology, was established as a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology remained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself, was amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student could be boredom, one should keep in mind that the detailed description, was utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes drew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms and their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and helpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary biology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation of plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or behavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description of morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for plants and animals. 2019—2020",1

The evaluation entails summing up the effect of inﬁnitesimal current elements (1 dl) mentioned in the previous section. We assume that the current I is steady and that the evaluation is carried out in free space (i.e., vacuum). Figure 4.1 1 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady current I. The loop is placed in the y-z plane with its centre at the origin 0 and has a radius R. The x—axis is the axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld at the point P on this axis. Let xbe the distance of P from the centre 0 of the loop. Consider a conducting element dl of the loop. This is shown in Fig. 4.1 1.

Further, any element of the loop will be perpendicular to the displacement vector from the element to the axial point.

It is perpendicular to the plane formed by dl and I. It has an x—component de and a component perpendicular to x—axis, dB 1- When the components perpendicular to the x—axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result.

278,470,"l Physics ROGET’S SPIRAL FOR ATTRACTION BETWEEN PARALLEL CURRENTS Magnetic effects are generally smaller than electric effects. As a consequence, the force between currents is rather small, because of the smallness of the factor ,u. Hence it is difficult to demonstrate attraction or repulsion between currents. Thus, for 5 A current in each wire at a separation of 1cm, the force per metre would be 5 X 1041 N, which is about 50 mg weight. It would be like pulling a wire by a string going over a pulley to which a 50 mg weight is attached. The displacement of the wire would be quite unnoticeable. With the use of a soft spring, we can increase the effective length of the parallel current and by using mercury, we can make the displacement of even a few mm observable very dramatically. You will also need a constant-current supply giving a constant current of about 5 A. Take a soft spring whose natural period of oscillations is about 0.5 — 1s. Hang it vertically and some attach a pointed tip to its lower end, as shown in the 1 ﬁgure here. Take some mercury in a dish and adjust the spring such that the tip is just above the mercury (J surface. Take the DC current source, connect one of its U—mmm’ terminals to the upper end of the spring, and dip the other terminal in mercury. If the tip of the spring touches mercury, the circuit is completed through mercury. Let the DC source be put off to begin with. Let the tip be adjusted so that it just touches the mercury surface. Switch on the constant current supply, and watch the fascinating outcome. The spring shrinks with a j erk, the tip comes out of mercury (just by a m or so), the circuit is broken, the current stops, the spring relaxes and tries to come back to its original position, the tip again touches mercury establishing a current in the circuit, and the cycle continues with tick, tick, tick, . .. In the beginning, you may require some small adjustments to get a good effect. Keep your face away from mercury vapour as it is poisonous. Do not inhale mercury vapour for long. Example 4.10 The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field at a certain place is 3.0 ><10‘5 T and the direction of the field is from the geographic south to the geographic north.

Cut out long thin strips of white paper and lightly iron them. Take them near a TV screen or computer monitor. You will see that the strips get attracted to the screen. In fact they remain stuck to the screen for a while. It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth are brought close to each other, they repel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands (d) (6] (fl FIGURE 1.1 Rods and pith balls: like charges repel and OfWOOl or tWO pieces Of Silk cloth With unlike charges attract each other. which the rods were rubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s fur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur. If a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls (now-a—days we can use polystyrene balls) suspended by silk or nylon thread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled by the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a glass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a pith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with plastic rod [Fig. 1.1(f)]. These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of an entity which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire an electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested that there are two kinds of electrification and we find that (i) like charges repel and (ii) unlike charges attract each other. The experiments also demonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith balls on contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged by contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called the polarity of charge. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for . j. , any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified ””3165 glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they no longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light objects as they did on being electrified. Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged bodies are brought in contact.

281,497,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 237 — Robert Hooke (1635 - 1703 A.D.) Robert Hooke was born on July 18. 1635 in Freshwater. Isle of Wight. He was one of the most brilliant and versatile seventeenth century English scientists. He attended Oxford University but never graduated. Yet he was an extremely talented inventor. instrument—maker and building designer. He assisted Robert Boyle in the construction of Boylean air pump. In 1662. he was appointed as Curator of Experiments to the newly founded Royal Society. In 1665. he became Professor of Geometry in Gresham College where he carried out his astronomi— cal observations. He built a Gregorian reﬂecting telescope: discovered the fifth star in the trapezium and an asterism in the constellation Orion: suggested that Jupiter rotates on its axis; plotted detailed sketches of Mars which were later used in the 19111 century to determine the planet’s rate of rotation: stated the inverse square law to describe planetary motion, which Newton modified later etc. He was elected Fellow of Royal Society and also served as the Society's Secretary from 1667 to 1682. In his series of observations presented in Micrographia. he suggested wave theory of light and first used the word ‘cell‘ in a biological context as a result of his studies of cork. Robert Hooke is best known to physicists for his discovery of law of elasticity: Ut tensio, sic vis [This is a Latin expression and it means as the distortion. so the force). This law laid the basis for studies of stress and strain and for understanding the elastic materials. As a result of applied tangential force, there is a relative displacement Ax between opposite faces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 9.2(b). The strain so produced is known as shearing strain and it is defined as the ratio of relative displacement of the faces Ax to the length of the cylinder L. Ax Shearing strain = T = tan 0 (9.3) where 0 is the angular displacement of the cylinder from the vertical (original position of the cylinder). Usually 0 is very small, tan 0 is nearly equal to angle 0, (if 0 = 10°, for example, there is only 1% difference between 6 and tan 9). k—h—>l (a) (b) It can also be visualised, when a book is pressed with the hand and pushed horizontally, as shown in Fig. 9.2 (c). Thus, shearing strain = tan (9 z 0 (9.4) In Fig. 9.2 (d), a solid sphere placed in the ﬂuid under high pressure is compressed uniformly on all sides. The force applied by the ﬂuid acts in perpendicular direction at each point of the surface and the body is said to be under hydraulic compression. This leads to decrease in its volume without any change of its geometrical shape. The body develops internal restoring forces that are equal and opposite to the forces applied by the ﬂuid (the body restores its original shape and size when taken out from the ﬂuid).

282,666,"G RAVITATI ON 189 (2) The force of attraction due to a hollow spherical shell of uniform density, on a point mass situated inside it is zero. Qualitatively, we can again understand this result. Various regions of the spherical shell attract the point mass inside it in various directions. These forces cancel each other completely. 8.4 THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT The value of the gravitational constant G entering the Universal law of gravitation can be determined experimentally and this was first done by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798. The apparatus used by him is schematically shown in figure.8.6 Fig. 8.6 Schematic drawing of Cavendish’s experiment. SI and 82 are large spheres which are kept on either side (shown shades) of the masses at A and B. When the big spheres are taken to the other side of the masses (shown by dotted circles), the bar AB rotates a little since the torque reverses direction. The angle of rotation can be measured experimentally. The bar AB has two small lead spheres attached at its ends. The bar is suspended from a rigid support by a fine wire. Two large lead spheres are brought close to the small ones but on opposite sides as shown. The big spheres attract the nearby small ones by equal and opposite force as shown. There is no net force on the bar but only a torque which is clearly equal to F times the length of the bar,where F is the force of attraction between a big sphere and its neighbouring small sphere. Due to this torque, the suspended wire gets twisted till such time as the restoring torque of the wire equals the gravitational torque . If 9 is the angle of twist of the suspended wire, the restoring torque is proportional to 9, equal to 10. Where 1' is the restoring couple per unit angle of twist. 1 can be measured independently e.g. by applying a known torque and measuring the angle of twist. The gravitational force between the spherical balls is the same as if their masses are concentrated at their centres. Thus if d is the separation between the centres of the big and its neighbouring small ball, M and In their masses, the gravitational force between the big sphere and its neighouring small ball is. Mm d2 (8'6) If L is the length of the bar AB , then the torque arising out of F is F multiplied by L. At equilibrium, this is equal to the restoring torque and hence Mm 2 F=G G L=r 6 (8.7) Observation of 9 thus enables one to calculate G from this equation. Since Cavendish’s experiment, the measurement of G has been refined and the currently accepted value is G = 6.67><10‘11 N mZ/kg2 (8.8) 8.5 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY OF THE EARTH The earth can be imagined to be a sphere made of a large number of concentric spherical shells with the smallest one at the centre and the largest one at its surface. A point outside the earth is obviously outside all the shells. Thus, all the shells exert a gravitational force at the point outside just as if their masses are concentrated at their common centre according to the result stated in section 8.3. The total mass of all the shells combined is just the mass of the earth. Hence, at a point outside the earth, the gravitational force is just as if its entire mass of the earth is concentrated at its centre. For a point inside the earth, the situation is different. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.7 . 2019-20",0

Each step of ascent is represented by a pair of bases. At each step of ascent, the strand turns 36°. One full turn of the helical strand would involve ten steps or ten base pairs. Attempt drawing a line diagram. The pitch would be 34A. The rise per base pair would be 3.4A. This form Of DNA with the above mentioned salient features is called B- DNA. In higher classes, you will be told that there are more than a dozen forms of DNA named after English alphabets with unique structural features. 9.9 DYNAMIC STATE OF BODY CONSTITUENTS - CONCEPT OF METABOLISM What we have learnt till now is that living organisms, be it a simple bacterial cell, a protozoan, a plant or an animal, contain thousands of organic compounds. These compounds or biomolecules are present in certain concentrations (expressed as mols / cell or mols / litre etc.). One of the greatest discoveries ever made was the observation that all these biomolecules have a turn over. This means that they are constantly being changed into some other biomolecules and also made from some other biomolecules. This breaking and making is through chemical reactions constantly occuring in living organisms. Together all these chemical reactions are called metabolism. Each of the metabolic reactions results in the transformation Of biomolecules. A few examples for such metabolic transformations are: removal of CO2 from amino acids making an amino acid into an amine, removal of amino group in a nucleotide base; hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond in a disaccharide, etc. We can list tens and thousands of such examples. Majority of these metabolic reactions do not occur in isolation but are always linked to some other reactions. In other words, metabolites are converted into each other in a series of linked reactions called metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways are similar to the automobile trafﬁc in a city. These pathways are either linear or circular. These pathways criss- cross each other, i.e., there are trafﬁc junctions. Flow of metabolites through metabolic pathway has a deﬁnite rate and direction like automobile traffic. This metabolite ﬂow is called the dynamic state of body constituents. What is most important is that this interlinked metabolic trafﬁc is very smooth and without a single reported mishap for healthy conditions. Another feature of these metabolic reactions is that every chemical reaction is a catalysed reaction. There is no uncatalysed metabolic conversion in living systems. Even CO2 dissolving in water, a physical process, is a catalysed reaction in living systems. The catalysts which hasten the rate of a given metabolic conversation are also proteins. These proteins with catalytic power are named enzymes.",1

They may be freeliving, aquatic and terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals. Roundworms have organ-system level of body organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals. Alimentary canal is complete with a well- developed muscular pharynx. An excretory tube removes body wastes from the body cavity through the excretory pore. Sexes are separate (dioecious), i.e., males and females are distinct. Often females are longer than males. Fertilisation is internal and development may be direct (the young ones resemble the adult) or indirect. Examples : Ascaris (Roundworm), Wuchereria (Filaria worm), Ancylos to ma (Hookworm). 4.2.6 Phylum — Annelida They may be aquatic (marine and fresh water) or terrestrial; free-living, and sometimes parasitic. They exhibit organ-system level of body organisation and bilateral symmetry. They are triploblastic, metamerically segmented and coelomate animals. Their body surface is distinctly marked out into segments or metameres and, hence, the phylum name Annelida (Latin, annulus : little ring) (Figure 4.1 1). They possess longitudinal and circular muscles which help in locomotion. Aquatic annelids like Nereis possess lateral appendages, parapodia, which help in swimming. A closed circulatory system is present. Nephridia (sing. nephridium) help in osmoregulation and excretion. Neural system consists of paired ganglia (sing. ganglion) connected by lateral nerves to a double ventral nerve cord. Nereis, an aquatic form, is dioecious, but earthworms and leeches are monoecious. Reproduction is sexual. Examples : Nereis, Pheretima (Earthworm) and H irudinaria (Blood sucking leech).",1
286,616,"l Physics instruments such as telescopes or microscopes is limited due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Indeed the colours that you see when a CD is viewed is due to diffraction effects. We will now discuss the phenomenon of diffraction. 10.6.1 The single slit In the discussion of Young’s experiment, we stated that a single narrow slit acts as a new source from which light spreads out. Even before Young, early experimenters — including Newton — had noticed that light spreads out from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and enter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as diffraction, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all, you are hardly surprised to hear sound waves from someone talking around a corner! When the double slit in Young’s experiment is replaced by a single narrow slit (illuminated by a monochromatic source), a broad pattern with a central bright region is seen. On both sides, there are alternate dark and bright regions, the intensity becoming weaker away from the centre (Fig. 10.16). To understand this, go to Fig. 10.1 5, which shows a parallel beam of light falling normally on a single slit LN of width a. The diffracted light goes on to meet a screen. The midpoint of the slit is M. A straight line through M perpendicular to the slit plane meets the screen at C. We want the intensity at any point P on the screen. As before, straight lines j oining P to the different points L,M,N, etc., can be treated as parallel, making an angle Owith the normal MC. The basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller parts, and add their contributions at P with the proper phase differences. We are treating different parts of the wavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because the incoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these sources are in phase. The path difference NP — LP between the two edges of the slit can be calculated exactly as for Young’s experiment. From Fig. 10.15, NP—LP=NQ =asin0 z a 0 (for smaller angles) (10.2 1) Similarly, if two points M1 and M2 in the slit plane are separated by y, the path difference M2P — MlP z ye. We now have to sum up equal, coherent contributions from a large number of sources, each with a different phase. This calculation was made by Fresnel using integral calculus, so we omit it here. The main features of the diffraction pattern can be understood by simple arguments. At the central point C on the screen, the angle 0 is zero. All path differences are zero and hence all the parts of the slit contribute in phase. 368 This gives maximum intensity at C. Experimental observation shown in 2019-20",0

The food mixes thoroughly with the acidic gastric juice of the stomach by the churning movements of its muscular wall and is called the chyme. ’Ihe proenzyme pepsinogen, on exposure to hydrochloric acid gets converted into the active enzyme pepsin, the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach. Pepsin converts proteins into proteoses and peptones (peptides). The mucus and bicarbonates present in the gastric juice play an important role in lubrication and protection of the mucosal epithelium from excoriation by the highly concentrated hydrochloric acid. HCl provides the acidic pH (pH 1.8) optimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice of infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins. Small amounts of lipases are also secreted by gastric glands. Various types of movements are generated by the muscularis layer of the small intestine. These movements help in a thorough mixing up of the food with various secretions in the intestine and thereby facilitate digestion. The bile, pancreatic juice and the intestinal juice are the secretions released into the small intestine. Pancreatic juice and bile are released through the hepato-pancreatic duct. The pancreatic juice contains inactive enzymes — trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidases, amylases, lipases and nucleases. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme, enterokinase, secreted by the intestinal mucosa into active trypsin, which in turn activates the other enzymes in the pancreatic juice. The bile released into the duodenum contains bile pigments (bilirubin and bili-verdin), bile salts, cholesterol and phospholipids but no enzymes. Bile helps in emulsiﬁcation of fats, i.e., breaking down of the fats into very small micelles. Bile also activates lipases. The intestinal mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus. The secretions of the brush border cells of the mucosa alongwith the secretions of the goblet cells constitute the intestinal juice or succus entericus. This juice contains a variety of enzymes like disaccharidases (e. g., maltase), dipeptidases, lipases, nucleosidases, etc. The mucus alongwith the bicarbonates from the pancreas protects the intestinal mucosa from acid as well as provide an alkaline medium (pH 7 .8) for enzymatic activities. Sub-mucosal glands (Brunner’s glands) also help in this.",1

289,122,"282 i Physics 8.4.3 Infrared waves Infrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. This band lies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible spectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This is because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb infrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorb infrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is, they heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in physical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in maintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the greenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily through the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re- radiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is trapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour. Infrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes and to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example semiconductor light emitting diodes) also emit infrared and are widely used in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV sets, video recorders and hi-fi systems. 8.4.4 Visible rays It is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the spectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about 4 X 1014 Hz to about 7 X 1014 Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 — 400 nm. Visible light emitted or reﬂected from objects around us provides us information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of wavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of wavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the ‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet. 8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays It covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 X 10‘7 m (400 nm) down to 6 X 10‘10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special lamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet light. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the atmosphere at an altitude of about 40 — 50 km. UV light in large quantities has harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the production of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is absorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn through glass windows. Welders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows to protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs. Due to its shorter wavelengths, UV radiations can be focussed into very narrow beams for high precision applications such as LASIK (Laser- assisted in situ keratomileusis) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill germs in water purifiers. Ozone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its depletion by chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter of international concern. 2019-20",0

292,1355,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS incident light beyond a point causes the breakdown of chlorophyll and a decrease in photosynthesis. 13.10.2 Carbon dioxide Concentration Carbon dioxide is the major limiting factor for photosynthesis. The concentration of CO2 is very low in the atmosphere (between 0.03 and 0.04 per cent). Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent can cause an increase in CO2 ﬁxation rates; beyond this the levels can become damaging over longer periods. The C3 and C 4 plants respond differently to CO2 concentrations. At low light conditions neither group responds to high CO2 conditions. At high light intensities, both C3 and C 4 plants show increase in the rates of photosynthesis. What is important to note is that the C 4 plants show saturation at about 360 ulL‘1 while C3 responds to increased CO2 concentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 ulL'l. Thus, current availability of CO2 levels is limiting to the C3 plants. The fact that C3 plants respond to higher 002 concentration by showing increased rates of photosynthesis leading to higher productivity has been used for some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and bell pepper. They are allowed to grow in carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere that leads to higher yields. 1 3. l 0. 3 Temperature The dark reactions being enzymatic are temperature controlled. Though the light reactions are also temperature sensitive they are affected to a much lesser extent. The C 4 plants respond to higher temperatures and show higher rate of photosynthesis while C3 plants have a much lower temperature optimum. The temperature optimum for photosynthesis of different plants also depends on the habitat that they are adapted to. Tropical plants have a higher temperature optimum than the plants adapted to temperate climates. 13. 10.4 Water Even though water is one of the reactants in the light reaction, the effect of water as a factor is more through its effect on the plant, rather than directly on photosynthesis. Water stress causes the stomata to close hence reducing the CO2 availability. Besides, water stress also makes leaves wilt, thus, reducing the surface area of the leaves and their metabolic activity as well.",1

With this choice, the Celsius temperature of the melting point of water and boiling point of water (both at 1 atm pressure) are very close to, but not exactly equal to 0 °C and 100 °C respectively. In the original Celsius scale, these latter ﬁxed points were exactly at 0 °C and 100 °C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the preferred choice for the ﬁxed point, because it has a unique temperature. A liquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pressure and temperature throughout the system; the two phases in equilibrium differ in their molar volume [i.e. density). This is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium. Heat transfer always involves temperature difference between two systems or two parts of the same system. Any energy transfer that does not involve temperature difference in some way is not heat. Convection involves ﬂow of matter within a ﬂuid due to unequal temperatures of its parts. A hot bar placed under a running tap loses heat by conduction between the surface of the bar and water and not by convection within water. EXERCISES",0
294,1231,"220 BIOLOGY rich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but lack PEPcase. Thus, the basic pathway that results in the formation of the sugars, the Calvin pathway, is common to the C3 and C 4 plants. Did you note that the Calvin pathway occurs in all the mesophyll cells of the C3 plants? In the C4 plants it does not take place in the mesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells. 13.9 PHOTORESPIRATION Let us try and understand one more process that creates an important difference between C3 and C 4 plants — Photorespiration. To understand photorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the ﬁrst step of the Calvin pathway — the ﬁrst CO2 fixation step. This is the reaction where RuBP combines with CO2 to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is catalysed by RuBisCO. RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 — hence the name. Can you think how this could be possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the C02: 02 is nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This binding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some 02 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 ﬁxation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C 4 plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site. This takes place when the C 4 acid from the mesophyll is broken down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO2 — this results in increasing the intracellular concentration of C02. In turn, this ensures that the RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity. Now that you know that the C 4 plants lack photorespiration, you probably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these plants. In addition these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures. Based on the above discussion can you compare plants showing the C3 and the C4 pathway?

The formulae we have derived earlier for series and parallel combinations of resistors are not always sufficient to determine all the currents and potential differences in the circuit. Two rules, called Kirchhoff 3 rules, are very useful for analysis of electric circuits. Given a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a symbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I ﬂows along the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined to be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the arrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually ﬂows in a direction opposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other source of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled, as well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current ﬂowing through the cell.

297,723,"10. 11. This is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of the nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear matter. After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, E = m2, we cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of conservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that this principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is central to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a source of power. Using the principle, Q of a nuclear process [decay or reaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses. The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that exothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse or when a heavy nucleus undergoes ﬁssion into nuclei with intermediate mass. For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to overcome the coulomb potential barrier. That is why fusion requires very high temperatures. Although the binding energy (per nucleon) curve is smooth and slowly varying. it shows peaks at nuclides like 4He, 160 etc. This is considered as evidence of atom—like shell structure in nuclei. Electrons and positron are a particle—antiparticle pair. They are identical in mass; their charges are equal in magnitude and opposite. [It is found that when an electron and a positron come together, they annihilate each other giving energy in the form of gamma—ray photons.) In é’—decay [electron emission), the particle emitted along with electron is anti—neutrino (17). On the other hand, the particle emitted in [3”— decay [positron emission) is neutrino (v). Neutrino and anti—neutrino are a particle-antiparticle pair. There are anti particles associated with every particle. What should be antiproton which is the anti particle of the proton? A free neutron is unstable [n —> p + e‘ + 17). But a similar free proton decay is not possible. since a proton is (slightly) lighter than a neutron. Gamma emission usually follows alpha or beta emission. A nucleus in an excited (higher) state goes to a lower state by emitting a gamma photon. A nucleus may be left in an excited state after alpha or beta emission. Successive emission of gamma rays from the same nucleus [as in case of “M, Fig. 13.4) is a clear proof that nuclei also have discrete energy levels as do the atoms. Radioactivity is an indication of the instability of nuclei. Stability requires the ratio of neutron to proton to be around 1:1 for light nuclei. This ratio increases to about 3:2 for heavy nuclei. [More neutrons are required to overcome the effect of repulsion among the protons.) Nuclei which are away from the stability ratio, i.e., nuclei which have an excess of neutrons or protons are unstable. In fact. only about 10% of knon isotopes [of all elements), are stable. Others have been either artificially produced in the laboratory by bombarding a, p, d, n or other particles on targets of stable nuclear species or identified in astronomical observations of matter in the universe. 2019-20 Nuclei 461",0

301,237,"276 PHYSICS APPENDIX 10. 1 : WHAT IS BLOOD PRESSURE ? In evolutionary history there occurred a time when animals started spending a significant amount of time in the upright position. This placed a number of demands on the circulatory system. The venous system that returns blood from the lower extremities to the heart underwent changes. You will recall that veins are blood vessels through which blood returns to the heart. Humans and animals such as the giraffe have adapted to the problem of moving blood upward against gravity. But animals such as snakes, rats and rabbits will die if held upwards, since the blood remains in the lower extremities and the venous system is unable to move it towards the heart. 26.8 kPa 9.3 kPa 13. kPa 13.3 kPa 13.1 kPa Fig. 1 0.26 Schematic view of the gauge pressures in the arteries in various parts of the human body while standing or lying down. The pressures shown are averaged over a heart cycle. Figure 10.26 shows the average pressures observed in the arteries at various points in the human body. Since viscous effects are small, we can use Bernoulli’s equation, Eq. (10.13), P + éva + pgy = Constant to understand these pressure values. The kinetic energy term [p v2/2] can be ignored since the velocities in the three arteries are small (: 0.1 m s4] and almost constant. Hence the gauge pressures at the brain PB, the heart PH, and the foot PF are related by PF=PH+ pth=PB+pghB [10.34] where p is the density of blood. Typical values of the heights to the heart and the brain are hH = 1.3 m and hB = 1.7m. Taking p = 1.06 x 103 kg m’3 we obtain that PF = 26.8 kPa (kilopascals) and PB = 9.3 kPa given that PH = 13.3 kPa. Thus the pressures in the lower and upper parts of the body are so different when a person is standing, but are almost equal when he is lying down. As mentioned in the text the units for pressure more commonly employed in medicine and physiology are torr and mm of Hg. 1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 0.133 kPa. Thus the average pressure at the heart is PH = 13.3 kPa = 100 mm of Hg. The human body is a marvel of nature. The veins in the lower extremities are equipped with valves, which open when blood ﬂows towards the heart and close if it tends to drain down. Also, blood is returned at least partially by the pumping action associated with breathing and by the ﬂexing of the skeletal muscles during walking. This explains why a soldier who is required to stand at attention may faint because of insufficient return of the blood to the heart. Once he is made to lie down, the pressures become equalized and he regains consciousness. An instrument called the sphygmomanometer usually measures the blood pressure of humans. It is a fast, painless and non—invasive technique and gives the doctor a reliable idea about the patients health. The measurement process is shown in Fig. 10.27. There are two reasons why the upper arm is used. First, it is at the same level as the heart and measurements here give values close to that at the heart. Secondly, the upper arm contains a single bone and makes the artery there [called the brachial artery) easy to compress. We have all measured pulse rates by placing our fingers over the wrist.

Unlike Coulomb’s law or the Newton’s law of gravitation there is no simple mathematical form of the nuclear force. 13.6 RADIOACTIVITY A. H. Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 purely by accident. While studying the ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence of compounds irradiated with visible light, Becquerel observed an interesting phenomenon. After illuminating some pieces of uranium-potassium sulphate with visible light, he wrapped them in black paper and separated the package from a photographic plate by a piece of silver. When, after several hours of exposure, the photographic plate was developed, it showed blackening due to something that must have been emitted by the compound and was able to penetrate both black paper and the silver. Experiments performed subsequently showed that radioactivity was a nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes a decay. This is referred to as radioactive decay. Three types of radioactive decay occur in nature : (i) OL-decay in which a helium nucleus :He is emitted; (ii) B-decay in which electrons or positrons (particles with the same mass as electrons, but with a charge exactly opposite to that of electron) are emitted; (iii) y—decay in which high energy (hundreds of keV or more) photons are emitted. Each of these decay will be considered in subsequent sub-sections. 13.6. 1 Law of radioactive decay In any radioactive sample, which undergoes on, B or Y—decay, it is found that the number of nuclei undergoing the decay per unit time is proportional to the total number of nuclei in the sample. If N is the number of nuclei in the sample and AN undergo decay in time At then MKN At or, AN/At=7LN, (13.10) where 7L is called the radioactive decay constant or disintegration constant. The change in the number of nuclei in the sample* is dN = — AN in time At. Thus the rate of change of N is (in the limit At a 0) dt * AN is the number of nuclei that decay, and hence is always positive. dN is the change in N, which may have either sign. Here it is negative, because out of original N nuclei, AN have decayed, leaving (N—AN) nuclei. 2019-20",0

(6.12), we get M12: M21: M (say) (6.14) We have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids. However, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid was much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then we could still have calculated the ﬂux linkage N1<I>1 because the inner solenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the outer solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M12 would be easy. However, it would be extremely difficult to calculate the ﬂux linkage with the outer solenoid as the magnetic ﬁeld due to the inner solenoid would vary across the length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the calculation of M21 would also be extremely difficult in this case. The equality M12=M21 is very useful in such situations. We explained the above example with air as the medium within the solenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability yr had been present, the mutual inductance would be M=Mo nlngn Til It is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of coils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative orientation. Example 6.9 Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius r1 and the other of large radius r , such that r1 << r2, are placed co-axially with centres coinciding. Obtain the mutual inductance of the arrangement. Solution Let a current I2 ﬂow through the outer circular coil. The field at the centre of the coil is 82 = ,uOI2 / 2r2. Since the other co-axially placed coil has a very small radius, 82 may be considered constant over its cross-sectional area.

308,1085,"PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION chromosomes, are produced by females, i.e., female heterogamety. In order to have a distinction with the mechanism of sex determination described earlier, the two different sex chromosomes of a female bird has been designated to be the Z and W chromosomes. In these organisms the females have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of Z—chromosomes besides the autosomes. 5.6. 1 Sex Determination in Humans It has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in case of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present, 22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes. A pair of X—chromosomes are present in the female, whereas the presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male characteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of gametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X—chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y—chromosome besides the autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with an X—chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the ovum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the ovum fertilises with a sperm carrying X—chromosome the zygote develops into a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y—chromosome carrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it is the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child. It is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent probability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in our society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and have been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion. 5.6.2 Sex Determination in Honey Bee The sex determination in honey bee is based on the number of sets of parents Female Mlale chromosomes an individual receives.

309,1009,"BIOMOLECULES The catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following steps: 1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, ﬁtting into the active site. 2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape, ﬁtting more tightly around the substrate. 3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the new enzyme- product complex is formed. 4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and run through the catalytic cycle once again. 9. 12.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity The activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions which can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include temperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of speciﬁc chemicals that regulate its activity. Temperature and pH Enzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH (Figure 9.7). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH. Activity declines both below and above the optimum value.

311,851,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS membrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast does not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is through mass ﬂow. As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or the atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the apoplast, hence mass ﬂow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive properties of water. The symplastic system is the system of interconnected protoplasts. Neighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that extend through plasmodesmata. During symplastic movement, the water travels through the cells — their cytoplasm; intercellular movement is through the plasmodesmata. Water has to enter the cells through the cell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again down a potential gradient. Symplastic movement may be aided by cytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming in cells of the Hydrilla leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming is easily visible. Most of the water ﬂow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the cortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water movement. However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the endodermis, is impervious to water because of a band of suberised matrix called the casparian strip. Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so they are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells proper through the membranes. The water then moves through the symplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem. The movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic in the endodermis. This is the only way water and other solutes can enter the vascular cylinder. Once inside the xylem, water is again free to move between cells as well as through them. In young roots, water enters directly into the xylem vessels and / or tracheids. These are non-living conduits and so are parts of the apoplast.

As they passed on this acquired character of elongated neck to succeeding generations, Giraffes, slowly, over the years, came to acquire long necks. Nobody believes this conjecture any more. Is evolution a process or the result of a process? The world we see, inanimate and animate, is only the success stories of evolution. When we describe the story of this world we describe evolution as a process. On the other hand when we describe the story of life on earth, we treat evolution as a consequence of a process called natural selection. We are still not very clear whether to regard evolution and natural selection as processes or end result of unknown processes. It is possible that the work of Thomas Malthus on populations inﬂuenced Darwin. Natural selection is based on certain observations which are factual. For example, natural resources are limited, populations are stable in size except for seasonal ﬂuctuation, members of a population vary in characteristics (infact no two individuals are alike) even though they look superﬁcially similar, most of variations are inherited etc. The fact that theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody reproduced maximally (this fact can be seen in a growing bacterial population) and the fact that population sizes in reality are limited, means that there had been competition for resources. Only some survived and grew at the cost of others that could not ﬂourish. The novelty and brilliant insight of Darwin was this: he asserted that variations, which are heritable and which make resource utilisation better for few (adapted to habitat better) will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny. Hence for a period of time, over many generations, survivors will leave more progeny and there would be a change in population characteristic and hence new forms appear to arise. 7.6 MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION What is the origin of this variation and how does speciation occur? Even though Mendel had talked of inheritable 'factors' inﬂuencing phenotype, Darwin either ignored these observations or kept silence. In the ﬁrst decade of twentieth century, Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose brought forth the idea of mutations — large difference arising suddenly in a population. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and not the minor variations (heritable) that Darwin talked about. Mutations are random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and directional. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed mutation caused speciation and hence called it saltation (single step large mutation). Studies in population genetics, later, brought out some clarity. 2019—2020 135",1

The reﬂected rays converge at a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)]. For a convex mirror, the reﬂected rays appear to diverge from a point F on its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the principal focus of the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making some angle with the principal axis, the reﬂected rays would converge (or appear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal axis.

318,1277,"STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION Plant breeding programmes are carried out in a systematic way worldwide—in government institutions and commercial companies. The main steps in breeding a new genetic variety of a crop are — (i) (ii) (in) (W) (V) Collection of variability: Genetic variability is the root of any breeding programme. In many crops pre-existing genetic variability is available from wild relatives of the crop. Collection and preservation of all the different wild varieties, species and relatives of the cultivated species (followed by their evaluation for their characteristics) is a pre-requisite for effective exploitation of natural genes available in the populations. The entire collection (of plants / seeds) having all the diverse alleles for all genes in a given crop is called germplasm collection. Evaluation and selection of parents: The germplasm is evaluated so as to identify plants with desirable combination of characters. The selected plants are multiplied and used in the process of hybridisation. Purelines are created wherever desirable and possible. Cross hybridisation among the selected parents: The desired characters have very often to be combined from two different plants (parents), for example high protein quality of one parent may need to be combined with disease resistance from another parent. This is possible by cross hybridising the two parents to produce hybrids that genetically combine the desired characters in one plant. This is a very time-consuming and tedious process since the pollen grains from the desirable plant chosen as male parent have to be collected and placed on the stigma of the ﬂowers selected as female parent (In chapter 2 details on how to make crosses have been described). Also, it is not necessary that the hybrids do combine the desirable characters; usually only one in few hundred to a thousand crosses shows the desirable combination. Selection and testing of superior recombinants: This step consists of selecting, among the progeny of the hybrids, those plants that have the desired character combination. The selection process is crucial to the success of the breeding objective and requires careful scientiﬁc evaluation of the progeny. This step yields plants that are superior to both of the parents (very often more than one superior progeny plant may become available). These are self-pollinated for several generations till they reach a state of uniformity (homozygosity), so that the characters will not segregate in the progeny. Testing, release and commercialisation of new cultivars: The newly selected lines are evaluated for their yield and other agronomic traits of quality, disease resistance, etc. This evaluation is done by growing these in the research fields and recording their performance under ideal fertiliser application, irrigation, and other crop management practices. The evaluation in research ﬁelds is followed 2019-2020 I7I",1
319,760,"254 PHYSICS In the experiment it is found that the mercury column in the barometer has a height of about 76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere (1 atm). This can also be obtained using the value of p in Eq. (10.8). A common way of stating pressure is in terms of cm or m of mercury (Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a torr (after Torricelli). 1 torr = 133 Pa. The mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine and physiology. In meteorology, a common unit is the bar and millibar. 1 bar = 105 Pa An open tube manometer is a useful instrument for measuring pressure differences. It consists of a U-tube containing a suitable liquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for measuring small pressure differences and a high density liquid (such as mercury) for large pressure differences. One end of the tube is open to the atmosphere and the other end is connected to the system whose pressure we want to measure [see Fig. 10.5 (b)]. The pressure Pat A is equal to pressure at point B. What we normally measure is the gauge pressure, which is P—Pa, given by Eq. (10.8) and is proportional to manometer height h. Fig 1 0.5 (a) The mercury barometer. 2019-20 (b) The open tube manometer Fig 1 0.5 Two pressure measuring devices. Pressure is same at the same level on both sides of the U-tube containing a ﬂuid. For liquids, the density varies very little over wide ranges in pressure and temperature and we can treat it safely as a constant for our present purposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits large variations of densities with changes in pressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids are, therefore, largely treated as incompressible. Example 10.3 The density of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m“. Assume that it does not change with altitude. Then how high would the atmosphere extend? AnswerWe use Eq.

The atmospheric cover extends with decreasing pressure over 100 km. We should also note that the sea level atmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of Hg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a sign of an approaching storm. 4 Example 1 0.4 At a depth of 1000 m in an ocean (a) what is the absolute pressure? (b) What is the gauge pressure?

320,1478,"ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND WEATHER SYSTEMS Land and Sea Breezes As explained earlier, the land and sea absorb and transfer heat differently. During the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea. Therefore, over the land the air rises giving rise to a low pressure area, whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure over sea is relatively high. Thus, pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land as the sea breeze. In the night the reversal of condition takes place. The land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea. The pressure gradient is from the land to the sea and hence land breeze results (Figure 10.7). Sea Breeze Land Breeze Figure 10.7 ; Land and sea breezes Mountain and Valley Winds In mountainous regions, during the day the slopes get heated up and air moves upslope and to fill the resulting gap the air from the valley blows up the valley. This wind is known 89 as the valley breeze. During the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind. The cool air, of the high plateaus and ice fields draining into the valley is called katabatic wind. Another type of warm wind occurs on the leeward side of the mountain ranges. The moisture in these winds, while crossing the mountain ranges condense and precipitate. When it descends down the leeward side of the slope the dry air gets warmed up by adiabatic process. This dry air may melt the snow in a short time. Air Masses When the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, it acquires the characteristics of the area. The homogenous regions can be the vast ocean surface or vast plains. The air with distinctive characteristics in terms of temperature and humidity is called an airmass. It is defined as a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions. The air masses are classified according to the source regions. There are five major source regions. These are: (i) Warm tropical and subtropical oceans; (ii) The subtropical hot deserts; (iii) The relatively cold high latitude oceans; (iv) The very cold snow covered continents in high latitudes; (v) Permanently ice covered continents in the Arctic and Antarctica. Accordingly, following types of air- masses are recognised: (i) Maritime tropical (mT); (ii) Continental tropical (cT); (iii) Maritime polar (mP); (iv) Continental polar (cP); (v) Continental arctic (cA). Tropical air masses are warm and polar air masses are cold. Fronts When two different air masses meet, the boundary zone between them is called a front. The process of formation of the fronts is known as frontogenesis. There are four types of fronts: (a) Cold; (b) Warm; (c) Stationary; (d) Occluded. When the front remains stationary, it is called a stationary front. When the cold air moves 2019-2020",2

The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of magnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz force. It is given by the expression: F = q (v x B + E) The magnetic force q (v X B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero. 2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I experiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B, F = I l X B wherelll = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the current. 3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in a plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called the cyclotron frequency and is given by: B Vc = q 2 n m This frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This fact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to accelerate charged particles. 4.

322,1453,"MOVEMENTS OF OCEAN WATER wave moves to a new position (Figure 14.1). The actual motion of the water beneath the waves is circular. It indicates that things are carried up and forward as the wave approaches, and down and back as it passes. Characteristics of Waves Wave crest and trough : The highest and lowest points of a wave are called the crest and trough respectively. Wave height : It is the vertical distance from the bottom of a trough to the top of a crest of a wave. Wave amplitude : It is one-half of the wave height. Wave period: It is merely the time interval between two successive wave crests or troughs as they pass a fixed point. Wavelength: It is the horizontal distance between two successive crests. Wave speed : It is the rate at which the wave moves through the water, and is measured in knots. Wave jrequency : It is the number of waves passing a given point during a one- second time interval. TIDEs The periodical rise and fall of the sea level, once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction of the sun and the moon, is called a tide. Movement of water caused by meteorological effects (winds and atmospheric pressure changes) are called surges. Surges are not regular like tides. The study of tides is very complex, spatially and temporally, as it has great variations in frequency, magnitude and height. The moon’s gravitational pull to a great extent and to a lesser extent the sun’s gravitational pull, are the major causes for the occurrence of tides. Another factor is centrifugal force, which is the force that acts to counter balance the gravity. Together, the gravitational pull and the centrifugal force are responsible for creating the two major tidal bulges on the earth. On the side of the earth facing the moon, a tidal bulge occurs while on the opposite side though the gravitational attraction of the moon 117 is less as it is farther away, the centrifugal force causes tidal bulge on the other side (Figure 1 4. 2) . The ‘tide-generating’ force is the difference between these two forces; i.e. the gravitational attraction of the moon and the centrifugal force. On the surface of the earth, nearest the moon, pull or the attractive force of the moon is greater than the centrifugal force, and so there is a net force causing a bulge towards the moon. On the opposite side of the earth, the attractive force is less, as it is farther away from the moon, the centrifugal force is dominant. Hence, there is a net force away from the moon. It creates the second bulge away from the moon. On the surface of the earth, the horizontal tide generating forces are more important than the vertical forces in generating the tidal bulges. Tidal bulge / S GRAVITATIoNAL FORCE Tidal bulge s U N CENTETEUGAL FORCE Two resultant tidal bulges ZCIUi Gravitational and Centrifugal Forces Figure 14.2 : Relation between gravitational forces and tides The tidal bulges on wide continental shelves, have greater height. When tidal bulges hit the mid-oceanic islands they become low. The shape of bays and estuaries along a coastline can also magnify the intensity of tides. Funnel-shaped bays greatly change tidal magnitudes. When the tide is channelled between islands or into bays and estuaries they are called tidal currents. 2019-2020",2
323,621,"Wave Optics slit diffraction pattern on the screen. The centre of the central bright fringe will appear at a point which lies on the straight line SS1 or SS2, as the case may be. We now compare and contrast the interference pattern with that seen for a coherently illuminated single slit (usually called the single slit diffraction pattern). (i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands. The diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum which is twice as wide as the other maxima. The intensity falls as we go to successive maxima away from the centre, on either side. (ii) We calculate the interference pattern by superposing two waves originating from the two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit. (iii) For a single slit of width a, the first null of the interference pattern occurs at an angle of l/ a. At the same angle of l/ a, we get a maximum (not a null) for two narrow slits separated by a distance a. One must understand that both d and a have to be quite small, to be able to observe good interference and diffraction patterns. For example, the separation 01 between the two slits must be of the order of a milimetre or so. The width a of each slit must be even smaller, of the order of 0.1 or 0.2 mm. In our discussion of Young’s experiment and the single-slit diffraction, we have assumed that the screen on which the fringes are formed is at a large distance. The two or more paths from the slits to the screen were treated as parallel. This situation also occurs when we place a converging lens after the slits and place the screen at the focus. Parallel paths from the slit are combined at a single point on the screen. Note that the lens does not introduce any extra path dtﬁerences in a parallel beam. This arrangement is often used since it gives more intensity than placing the screen far away. If f is the focal length of the lens, then we can easily work out the size of the central bright maximum. In terms of angles, the separation of the central maximum from the ﬁrst null of the diffraction pattern is A/ a. Hence, the size on the screen will be f A / a. 10.6.2 Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern It is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself. The equipment needed can be found in most homes — two razor blades and one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament. One has to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a narrow slit in between. This is easily done with the thumb and forefmgers (Fig. 10.18). Keep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye. Use spectacles if you normally do. With slight adjustment of the width of the slit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen with its bright and dark bands. Since the position of all the bands (except the central one) depends on wavelength, they will show some colours. Using a filter for red or blue will make the fringes clearer. With both filters available, the wider fringes for red compared to blue can be seen. 2019-20 W W FIGURE 10.18 Holding two blades to form a single slit.

(6.28). For deuterium m2 = 2m1 and we obtain f1 = 1/9 whilef2 = 8/9. Almost 90% of the neutron’s energy is transferred to deuterium. For carbon j""1 = 71.6% and f2 = 28.4%. In practice, however, this number is smaller since head-on collisions are rare. 4 If the initial velocities and final velocities of both the bodies are along the same straight line, then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or head-on collision. In the case of small spherical bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel of body 1 passes through the centre of body 2 which is at rest. In general, the collision is two- dimensional, where the initial velocities and the final velocities lie in a plane. 6. 12.3 Collisions in Two Dimensions Fig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving mass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear momentum is conserved in such a collision. Since momentum is a vector this implies three equations for the three directions (x, y, 2}. Consider the plane determined by the final velocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to be the x—y plane. The conservation of the z-component of the linear momentum implies that the entire collision is in the x—y plane.

Coordination is the process through which two or more organs interact and complement the functions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises, the energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscular activity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply of oxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and increased blood ﬂow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped, the activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their normal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical exercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function in a synchronised fashion. The neural system provides an organised network of point-to-point connections for a quick coordination. The endocrine system provides chemical integration through hormones. In this chapter, you will learn about the neural system of human, mechanisms of neural coordination like transmission of nerve impulse, impulse conduction across a synapse and the physiology of reﬂex action. 2019-2020",1

The total force F1 on the charge ql, due to all other charges, is then given by the vector sum of the forces F12, F13, F1“: i.e., 1 cm - qq A qq - F =F +F +...+F = 12:- +—1——3—r +...+ 1”: l 12 13 In 47580 r122 12 r123 13 12,1 In Q1 n in _II‘ 47580 1:2 r121 h (1.5) The vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law of addition of vectors.

Of course using machines we can shoot an object with much greater speeds and with greater and greater initial speed, the object scales higher and higher heights. A natural query that arises in our mind is the following: ‘can we throw an object with such high initial speeds that it does not fall back to the earth?’ The principle of conservation of energy helps us to answer this question. Suppose the object did reach infinity and that its speed there was Vf. The energy of an object is the sum of potential and kinetic energy. As before W1 denotes that gravitational potential energy of the object at infinity.

Both are smaller than their values on earth and the escape speed for the moon turns out to be 2.3 km/s, about five times smaller. This is the reason that moon has no atmosphere.

328,1001,"NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION 2 1 .4. l Forebrain The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus (Figure 2 1.4). Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep cleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed as the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The hemispheres are connected by a tract of nerve ﬁbres called corpus callosum. The layer of cells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is thrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey matter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are concentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor areas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory nor motor in function. These regions called as the association areas are responsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory and communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath, which constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an opaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter. The cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major coordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very important part of the brain called hypothalamus lies at the base of the thalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control body temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several groups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called hypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc., form a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along with the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and fear), and motivation. 2 l .4.2 Midbrain The midbrain is located between the thalamus / hypothalamus of the forebrain and pons of the hindbrain. A canal called the cerebral aqueduct passess through the midbrain. The dorsal portion of the midbrain consists mainly of four round swellings (lobes) called corpora quadrigemina. 2 1 .4. 3 Hindbrain The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla (also called the medulla oblongata). Pons consists of ﬁbre tracts that interconnect different regions of the brain. Cerebellum has very convoluted surface in order to provide the additional space for many more neurons. The medulla of the brain is connected to the spinal cord. The medulla contains centres which control respiration, cardiovascular reﬂexes and gastric secretions. Three major regions make up the brain stem; mid brain, pons and medulla oblongata. Brain stem forms the connections between the brain and spinal cord. 321",1
329,1266,"316 BIOLOGY 21. 1 NEURAL SYSTEM The neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells called neurons which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli. The neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. For example, in Hydra it is composed of a network of neurons. The neural system is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along with a number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a more developed neural system. 21.2 HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM The human neural system is divided into two parts : (i) the central neural system (CNS) (ii) the peripheral neural system (PNS) The CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord and is the site of information processing and control. The PNS comprises of all the nerves of the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve ﬁbres of the PNS are of two types : (a) afferent fibres (b) efferent ﬁbres The afferent nerve ﬁbres transmit impulses from tissues / organs to the CNS and the efferent ﬁbres transmit regulatory impulses from the CNS to the concerned peripheral tissues / organs. The PNS is divided into two divisions called somatic neural system and autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system relays impulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural system transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and smooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further classiﬁed into sympathetic neural system and parasympathetic neural system. Visceral nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that comprises the whole complex of nerves, ﬁbres, ganglia, and plexuses by which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the viscera and from the viscera to the central nervous system. 21.3 NEURON As STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL UNIT 0F NEURAL SYSTEM A neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely, cell body, dendrites and axon (Figure 2 1. 1). The cell body contains cytoplasm with typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called Nissl’s granules Short ﬁbres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also",1
330,1060,"BIOLOGY Mammals from colder climates generally have shorter ears and limbs to minimise heat loss. (This is called the Allen’s Rule.) In the polar seas aquatic mammals like seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) below their skin that acts as an insulator and reduces loss of body heat. Some organisms possess adaptations that are physiological which allow them to respond quickly to a stressful situation. If you had ever been to any high altitude place (>3,500m Rohtang Pass near Manali and Leh you must have experienced what is called altitude sickness. Its symptoms include nausea, fatigue and heart palpitations. This is because in the low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, the body does not get enough oxygen. But, gradually you get acclimatised and stop experiencing altitude sickness. How did your body solve this problem? The body compensates low oxygen availability by increasing red blood cell production, decreasing the binding affinity of hemoglobin and by increasing breathing rate. Many tribes live in the high altitude of Himalayas. Find out if they normally have a higher red blood cell count (or total hemoglobin) than people living in the plains. In most animals, the metabolic reactions and hence all the physiological functions proceed optimally in a narrow temperature range (in humans, it is 37 OC). But there are microbes (archaebacteria) that ﬂourish in hot springs and deep sea hydrothermal vents where temperatures far exceed 100°C. How is this possible? Many ﬁsh thrive in Antarctic waters where the temperature is always below zero. How do they manage to prevent their body ﬂuids from freezing? A large variety of marine invertebrates and ﬁsh live at great depths in the ocean where the pressure could be > 100 times the normal atmospheric pressure that we experience. How do they live under such high pressures and do they have any special enzymes? Organisms living in such extreme environments show a fascinating array of biochemical adaptations. Some organisms show behavioural responses to cope up with variations in their environment. Desert lizards lack the physiological ability that mammals have to deal with the high temperatures of their habitat, but manage to keep their body temperature fairly constant by behavioural means. They bask in the sun and absorb heat when their body temperature drops below the comfort zone, but move into shade when the ambient temperature starts increasing. Some species are capable of burrowing into the soil to hide and escape from the above-ground heat. 13.2 POPULATIONS 13.2. 1 Population Attributes In nature, we rarely ﬁnd isolated, single individuals of any species; majority of them live in groups in a well deﬁned geographical area, share or compete for similar resources, potentially interbreed and thus constitute a population.

The water—air reﬂected ray, therefore, is always less intense D 04? Interface than the incident ray, howsoever smooth the reﬂecting surface may be. In total internal reflection, on the other hand, no transmission of light takes place. The angle of incidence corresponding to an angle of refraction 90°, say LAOSN, is called the critical angle (ic) for the given pair FIGURE 9. 12 Refraction and internal reﬂection ofmedia. We see from Snell’s laW [Eq. (9. 10)] (1) Denser reﬂected ray medium Partially (water) A C reﬂected rays of rays from a point A in the denser medium that if the relative refractive index is less (water) incident at different angles at the interface than one then, since the maximum value With a rarer “ledium (air). of sin r is unity, there is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law can be satisfied, that is, i = ic such that sin is = n21 (9.12) For values of i larger than ic, Snell’s law of refraction cannot be satisﬁed, and hence no refraction is possible. The refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium 2 will be n12 = 1 / sin ic. Some typical critical angles are listed in Table 9. 1.

Take a laser pointer and shine its beam through the turbid water. You will find that the path of the beam inside the water shines brightly. Shine the beam from below the beaker such that it strikes at the upper water surface at the other end. Do you find that it undergoes partial reﬂection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction [which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.1 3(a)]?

333,390,"262 PHYSICS Aerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 10.13 (c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece shaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when it moves horizontally through air. The cross- section of the wings of an aeroplane looks somewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig. 10.13 (c) with streamlines around it. When the aerofoil moves against the wind, the orientation of the wing relative to ﬂow direction causes the streamlines to crowd together above the wing more than those below it. The ﬂow speed on top is higher than that below it. There is an upward force resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and this balances the weight of the plane. The following example illustrates this. Example 1 0.8 A fully loaded Boeing aircraft has a mass of 3.3 x 105 kg. Its total wing area is 500 n12. It is in level ﬂight with a speed of 960 km/h. (a) Estimate the pressure difference between the lower and upper surfaces of the wings (b) Estimate the fractional increase in the speed of the air on the upper surface of the wing relative to the lower surface. [The density of air is p = 1.2 kg m’“] Answer (a) The weight of the Boeing aircraft is balanced by the upward force due to the pressure difference APXA=3.3 x 105ng 9.8 Ap= (3.3x 105 kg>< 9.8mS'2) / 500 m2 = 6.5 X 103 Nm‘2 (b) We ignore the small height difference between the top and bottom sides in Eq.

This resistance to ﬂuid motion is like an intemal friction analogous to ﬁ'iction when a solid moves on a surface. It is called viscosity. This force exists when there is relative motion between layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider a ﬂuid like oil enclosed between two glass plates as shown in Fig. 1 O. 14 (a). The bottom plate is ﬁxed while the top plate is moved with a constant velocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is replaced by honey, a greater force is required to move the plate with the same velocity. Hence we say that honey is more viscous than oil. The ﬂuid in contact with a surface has the same velocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer of the liquid in contact with top surface moves with a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in contact with the fixed surface is stationary. The velocities of layers increase uniformly from bottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity v). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls it forward while lower layer pulls it backward. This results in force between the layers. This type of ﬂow is known as laminar. The layers of liquid slide over one another as the pages of a book do when it is placed ﬂat on a table and a horizontal force is applied to the top cover. When a ﬂuid is ﬂowing in a pipe or a tube, then velocity of the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is maximum and decreases gradually as we move towards the walls where it becomes zero, Fig. 10.14 (b). The velocity on a cylindrical surface in a tube is constant. On account of this motion, a portion of liquid, which at some instant has the shape ABCD, take the shape of AEFD after short interval of time",0

It tells us that the electrons move with an average velocity which is independent of time, although electrons are accelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the velocity vd in Eq.

Ecology is basically concerned with four levels of biological organisation — organisms, populations, communities and biomes. In this chapter we explore ecology at organismic and population levels. 13.1 ORGANISM AND ITS ENVIRONMENT Ecology at the organismic level is essentially physiological ecology which tries to understand how different organisms are adapted to their environments in terms of not only survival but also reproduction. You may have learnt in earlier classes how the rotation of our planet around the Sun and the tilt of its axis cause annual variations in the intensity and duration of temperature, resulting in distinct seasons. These variations together with annual variation in precipitation (remember precipitation includes both rain and snow) account for the formation of major biomes such as desert, rain forest and tundra (Figure 13.1).

The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neural mechanisms causing it is called the micturition reﬂex. An adult human excretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formed is a light yellow coloured watery ﬂuid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0) and has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea is excreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics of urine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolic discorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presence of glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine are indicative of diabetes mellitus. 19.7 ROLE OF OTHER ORGANS IN EXCRETION Other than the kidneys, lungs, liver and skin also help in the elimination of excretory wastes. Our lungs remove large amounts of CO2 (approximately 200mL/ minute) and also signiﬁcant quantities of water every day. Liver, the largest gland in our body, secretes bile-containing substances like bilirubin, biliverdin, cholesterol, degraded steroid hormones, vitamins and drugs. Most of these substances ultimately pass out alongwith digestive wastes. The sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin can eliminate certain substances through their secretions. Sweat produced by the sweat glands is a watery ﬂuid containing NaCl, small amounts of urea, lactic acid, etc. Though the primary function of sweat is to facilitate a cooling effect on the body surface, it also helps in the removal of some of the wastes mentioned above. Sebaceous glands eliminate certain substances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum. This secretion provides a protective oily covering for the skin. Do you know that small amounts of nitrogenous wastes could be eliminated through saliva too? 19.8 DISORDERS OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM Malfunctioning of kidneys can lead to accumulation of urea in blood, a condition called uremia, which is highly harmful and may lead to kidney failure. In such patients, urea can be removed by a process called hemodialysis. During the process of haemodialysis, the blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit called artiﬁcial kidney. Blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit after adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The unit contains a coiled cellophane tube surrounded by a ﬂuid (dialysing ﬂuid) having the same",1
338,113,"l Physics This wavelength is so small that it is beyond any measurement. This is the reason why macroscopic objects in our daily life do not show wave-like properties. On the other hand, in the sub-atomic domain, the wave character of particles is signiﬁcant and measurable. Consider an electron (mass m, charge e) accelerated from rest through a potential V. The kinetic energy K of the electron equals the work done (eV) on it by the electric ﬁeld: where V is the magnitude of accelerating potential in volts. For a 120 V accelerating potential, Eq. (1 1. 1 1) gives 2. = 0.1 12 nm. This wavelength is of the same order as the spacing between the atomic planes in crystals. This suggests that matter waves associated with an electron could be veriﬁed by crystal diffraction experiments analogous to X-ray diffraction. We describe the experimental veriﬁcation of the de Broglie hypothesis in the next section. In 1929, de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons. The matter—wave picture elegantly incorporated the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. According to the principle, it is not possible to measure both the position and momentum of an electron (or any other particle) at the same time exactly. There is always some uncertainty (A x) in the specification of position and some uncertainty (Ap) in the speciﬁcation of momentum. The product of Axand Ap is of the order of h* (with h = h/Zit), i.e., AxApzh (11.12) Equation (1 1.12) allows the possibility that Axis zero; but then Ap must be inﬁnite in order that the product is non-zero. Similarly, if Ap is zero, Ax must be inﬁnite. Ordinarily, both Ax and Ap are non-zero such that their product is of the order of h. Now, if an electron has a deﬁnite momentum p, (i.e.Ap = O), by the de Broglie relation, it has a deﬁnite wavelength A.

(ii) Field emission: By applying a very strong electric ﬁeld (of the order of 108 V m‘l) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a spark plug. (iii) Photoelectric emission: When light of suitable frequency illuminates a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These photo(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons. 1 1.3 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT 1 1.3.1 Hertz's observations The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz (1 857 - 1 894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments. In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp. Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of free, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions in the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the surrounding space. 1 1.3.2 Hallwachs’ and Lenard's observations Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of photoelectric emission in detail during 1886- 1902. Lenard (1862- 1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing two electrodes (metal plates), current ﬂows in the circuit (Fig. 1 1.1).

Majority of these studies employed either surviving tissue model or straightaway cell- free systems. An explosion of knowledge resulted in molecular biology. Molecular physiology became almost synonymous with biochemistry and biophysics. However, it is now being increasingly realised that neither a purely organismic approach nor a purely reductionistic molecular approach would reveal the truth about biological processes or living phenomena. Systems biology makes us believe that all living phenomena are emergent properties due to interaction among components of the system under study. Regulatory network of molecules, supra molecular assemblies, cells, tissues, organisms and indeed, populations and communities, each create emergent properties. In the chapters under this unit, major human physiological processes like digestion, exchange of gases, blood circulation, locomotion and movement are described in cellular and molecular terms. The last two chapters point to the coordination and regulation of body events at the organismic level. 2019-2020",1

SUMMARY Health is not just the absence of disease. It is a state of complete physical, mental, social and psychological well-being. Diseases like typhoid, cholera, pneumonia, fungal infections of skin, malaria and many others are a major cause of distress to human beings. Vector-borne diseases like malaria especially one caused by Plasmodium falciparum, if not treated, may prove fatal. Besides personal cleanliness and hygiene, public health measures like proper disposal of waste, decontamination of drinking water, control of vectors like mosquitoes and immunisation are very helpful in preventing these diseases. Our immune system plays the major role in preventing these diseases when we are exposed to disease-causing agents. The innate defences of our body like skin, mucous membranes, antimicrobial substances present in our tears, saliva and the phagocytic cells help to block the entry of pathogens into our body. If the pathogens succeed in gaining entry to our body, specific antibodies (humoral immune response) and cells (cell mediated immune response) serve to kill these pathogens. Immune system has memory. On subsequent exposure to same pathogen, the immune response is rapid and more intense. This forms the basis of protection 163 ""\va 2019-2020",1

He carried out a large series of experiments to explore the relationship between current electricity and magnetism. These investigations culminated in 1827 with the publication of the ‘Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Pheno- mena Deduced Solely from Experiments’. He‘ hypo- thesised that all magnetic phenomena are due to circulating electric currents. Ampere was humble and absent- minded. He once forgot an invitation to dine with the Emperor Napoleon. He died of pneumonia at the age of 61. His gravestone bears the epitaph: Tandem Felix (Happy at last). (i) B is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constant B, or (ii) B is normal to the loop, or (iii) B vanishes. Now, let Lbe the length (part) of the loop for which B is tangential. Let 18 be the current enclosed by the loop. Then, Eq. (4.1 7) reduces to, BL =p018 [4.17(b)] When there is a system with a symmetry such as for a straight inﬁnite current-carrying wire in Fig. 4.15, the Ampere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic field, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in determination of the electric ﬁeld. This is exhibited in the Example 4.9 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is a circle and magnetic field is tangential to the circumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand side of Eq. [4.17 (b)], B. 2m. We find that the magnetic field at a distance r outside the wire is tangential and given by BX 2m = #01, B = a0 1/ (2m) (4.18) The above result for the inﬁnite wire is interesting from several points of View. (i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of radius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in magnitude. In other words, the magnetic field possesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The field that normally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r. Whenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify. (ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it. Thus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic ﬁeld form concentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4. 1 (c), the iron ﬁlings form concentric circles. These lines called magnetic ﬁeld lines form closed loops. This is unlike the electrostatic ﬁeld lines which originate from positive charges and end at negative charges. The expression for the magnetic ﬁeld of a straight wire provides a theoretical justiﬁcation to Oersted’s experiments. (iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is inﬁnite, the ﬁeld due to it at a non-zero distance is not infinite. It tends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. The ﬁeld is directly proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source. 2019-20",0

This gives the appearance of a small fragment called the satellite. 8.5. 1 1 Microbodies Many membrane bound minute vesicles called microbodies that contain various enzymes, are present in both plant and animal cells. SUMMARY All organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, size and activities / functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as eukaryotic or prokaryotic. A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The endomembrane system IncludesEEréolgl complex, lysosomes and vacuoles.

The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts, which may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus is enclosed by nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores. The inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material.

The notion of the area as a vector has been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be extended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields. If the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at various parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic ﬂux through the surface is given by qu =Bl.dA1+BQ.dA2+---=ZBi.dAi (6.2) all where ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements dAi FIGURE 6.4 A plane of surface area A placed in a comprising the surface and Bi is the magnetic ﬁeld at the area element uniform] magnetic ﬁeld B. dAi.

Magnetic ﬂux is a scalar quantity. 6.4 FARADAY’S LAW OF INDUCTION From the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a conclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic ﬂux through the coil changes with time. Experimental observations discussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept. The motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towards or away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic ﬂux associated with coil CI. The change in magnetic ﬂux induces emf in coil Cl. It was this induced emf which caused electric current to ﬂow in coil C1 and through the galvanometer. A FIGURE 6.5 Magnetic field B. plausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is at the 1""“ area €1€ment~ dA, as follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in “Presents area VCCtor 0f the coil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a maximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic ﬂux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in magnetic ﬂux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1. When the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore, there is no change in the magnetic ﬂux through coil C1 and the current in coil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and the resulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a short time. This results in a decrease in magnetic ﬂux through coil C1 and hence again induces an electric current in coil 01*. The common point in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic ﬂux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental observations in the form of a law called Faraday ’3 law of electromagnetic induction. The law is stated below. * Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet can be damaged due to the induced emfs [and the resulting currents] when the electromagnet is turned on or off. 2019-20 1""“ area element. 207",0

BIB2 etc. are nomial to both Fle and GXG2 and represent rays. 354 small portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have What is known as a plane wave [Fig. 10.1(b)]. Now, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens principle allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time T. Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction, which given the shape of the wafefront at any time allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time. Let us consider a diverging wave and let F1F2 represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at t= 0 (Fig. 10.2). Now, according to Huygens principle, each point of the wavefront is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets emanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed of the wave. These wavelets emanating from the wavefront are usually referred to as secondary wavelets and if we draw a common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at a later time. FIGURE 10.2 FIF2 represents the spherical wavefront (with O as centre) at t = O. The envelope of the secondary wavelets emanating from FIF2 produces the forward moving wavefront GIGZ. The backwave DID2 does not exist. Thus, if we wish to determine the shape of the wavefront at t= T, we draw spheres of radius UT from each point on the spherical wavefront where v represents the speed of the waves in the medium. If we now draw a common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at t= T. The new wavefront shown as G1G2 in Fig. 10.2 is again spherical with point 0 as the centre. The above model has one shortcoming: we also have a backwave which is shown as D1D2 in Fig. 10.2. Huygens argued that the amplitude of the secondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the backward direction; by making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could explain the absence of the backwave. However, this adhoc assumption is not satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really j ustiﬁed from more rigorous wave theory. In a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the shape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium (Fig. 10.3). 2019-20",0

Therefore, the direction of velocity at any point on the path of an object is tangential to the path at that point and is in the direction of motion. We can express v in a component form : .

352,505,"Moving Charges and Magnetism (iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld due to a long wire. This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is: Grasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing in the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the direction of the magnetic field. Ampere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law. Both relate the magnetic ﬁeld and the current, and both express the same physical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to Biot—Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s and Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary (magnetic or electric ﬁeld) to another physical quantity, namely, the source, in the interior (current or charge).

The setup is then placed in light for some time. On testing for the presence of starch later in the two parts of the leaf, you must have found that the exposed part of the leaf tested positive for starch while the portion that was in the tube, tested negative. This showed that CO2 was required for photosynthesis. Can you explain how this conclusion could be drawn? 13.2 EARLY EXPERIMENTS It is interesting to learn about those simple experiments that led to a gradual development in our understanding of photosynthesis. Joseph Priestley (1 733- 1 804) in 1 770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air in the growth of green plants. Priestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in 1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in a closed space — a bell jar, soon gets extinguished (Figure 13.1 a, b, c, d). Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that a burning candle or an animal that breathe the air, both somehow, damage the air. But when he placed a mint plant in the same bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle continued to burn. Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove. Can you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment using a candle and a plant? Remember, he would need to rekindle the candle to test whether it burns after a few days. How many different ways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up? Using a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it once in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730- 17 99) showed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals. Ingenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not. Later he identiﬁed these bubbles to be of oxygen. Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that could release oxygen. 207 Figure 13.1 Priestley’s experiment",1
354,1313,"BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS SUMMARY Biotechnology has given to humans several useful products by using microbes, plant, animals and their metabolic machinery. Recombinant DNA technology has made it possible to engineer microbes, plants and animals such that they have novel capabilities. Genetically Modified Organisms have been created by using methods other than natural methods to transfer one or more genes from one organism to another, generally using techniques such as recombinant DNA technology. GM plants have been useful in increasing crop yields, reduce post- harvest losses and make crops more tolerant of stresses. There are several GM crop plants with improved nutritional value of foods and reduced the reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops). Recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more effective therapeutics. Since the recombinant therapeutics are identical to human proteins, they do not induce unwanted immunological responses and are free from risk of infection as was observed in case of similar products isolated from non-human sources. Human insulin is made in bacteria yet its structure is absolutely identical to that of the natural molecule. Transgenic animals are also used to understand how genes contribute to the development of a disease by serving as models for human diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s. Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individual’s cells and tissues to treat diseases especially hereditary diseases. It does so by replacing a defective mutant allele with a functional one or gene targeting which involves gene amplification. Viruses that attack their hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as part of their replication cycle are used as vectors to transfer healthy genes or more recently portions of genes. The current interest in the manipulation of microbes, plants, and animals has raised serious ethical questions. EXERCISES 1.

W The work done by a conservative force such as gravity depends on the initial and final positions only. In the previous chapter we have worked on examples dealing with inclined planes. If an object of mass m is released from rest, from the top of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of height h, its speed at the bottom is 29h irrespective of the angle of inclination. Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it acquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors such as the velocity or the particular path taken by the object, the force would be called non- conservative. The dimensions of potential energy are [MLZT ’2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as kinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change in potential energy, for a conservative force, AV is equal to the negative of the work done by the force AV = — FIX) Ax (6.9) In the example of the falling ball considered in this section we saw how potential energy was converted to kinetic energy. This hints at an important principle of conservation in mechanics, which we now proceed to examine. 6.8 THE CONSERVATION 0F MECHANICAL ENERGY For simplicity we demonstrate this important principle for one-dimensional motion. Suppose that a body undergoes displacement Ax under the action of a conservative force F. Then from the WE theorem we have, AK = Rx) Ax If the force is conservative, the potential energy function V(x) can be defined such that — AV = Rx) Ax The above equations imply that AK + AV = O A(K + V) = O (6.10) which means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the body is a constant. Over the whole path, xi to X], this means that K, + V(xi) = Kf + V(xf) (6.1 l) The quantity K +V(x), is called the total mechanical energy of the system. Individually the kinetic energy K and the potential energy V(x) may vary from point to point, but the sum is a constant. The aptness of the term ‘conservative force’ is now clear. Let us consider some of the definitions of a conservative force. 0 A force FIX) is conservative if it can be derived from a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation given by Eq. (6.9). The three-dimensional generalisation requires the use of a vector derivative, which is outside the scope of this book. 0 The work done by the conservative force depends only on the end points. This can be seen from the relation, W = Kf— Ki = V(xi) — V(xf) which depends on the end points. 0 A third definition states that the work done by this force in a closed path is zero. This is once again apparent from Eq. (6.1 1) since xi = xf_ Thus, the principle of conservation of total mechanical energy can be stated as The total mechanical energy of a system is conserved if the forces, doing work on it, are conservative. The above discussion can be made more concrete by considering the example of the gravitational force once again and that of the spring force in the next section.

The vectors provide the origin of replication. Further, not every detail of replication is understood well. In eukaryotes, the replication of DNA takes place at S—phase of the cell-cycle. The replication of DNA and cell division cycle should be highly coordinated. A failure in cell division after Continuous DNA replication results into polyploidy(a synthesis chromosomal anomaly). You will learn the detailed nature of origin and the processes occurring at this site, in higher classes. The process of copying genetic information from one strand of the DNA into RNA is termed as transcription. Here also, the principle of complementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine complements now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine. However, unlike in the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an organism gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and only one of the strands is copied into RNA. This necessitates defining the boundaries that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that would be transcribed. Why both the strands are not copied during transcription has the simple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code for RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity does not mean identical), and in turn, if they code for proteins, the sequence of amino acids in the proteins would be different. Hence, one segment of the DNA would be coding for two different proteins, and this would complicate the genetic information transfer machinery. Second, the two RNA molecules if produced simultaneously would be complementary to each other, hence would form a double stranded RNA. This would prevent RNA from being translated into protein and the exercise of transcription would become a futile one. 6.5. 1 Transcription Unit A transcription unit in DNA is deﬁned primarily by the three regions in the DNA: (i) A Promoter (ii) The Structural gene (iii) ATerminator 2019—2020 Newly synthesised \ 6.5 TRANSCRIPTION , strands Template DNA (parental strands) Discontinuous synthesis 3/ Figure 6.8 Replicating Fork 107",1

This is known as a Cassegrain telescope, after its inventor. It has the advantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope in India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter reﬂecting telescope (Cassegrain). It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. The largest reﬂecting telescopes in the world are the pair of Keck telescopes in Hawaii, USA, with a reﬂector of 10 metre in diameter. SUMMARY 1. Reﬂection is governed by the equation Ai = Ar’ and refraction by the Snell’s law, sini/ sinr = n, where the incident ray, reﬂected ray, refracted ray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reﬂection and refraction are i, r’ and r, respectively. 2. The critical angle of incidence iC for a ray incident from a denser to rarer medium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90°. For i> ic, total internal reﬂection occurs. Multiple internal reﬂections in diamond [iC a 24.4°), totally reﬂecting prisms and mirage, are some examples of total internal reﬂection. Optical fibres consist of glass fibres coated with a thin layer of material of lower refractive index. Light incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other, after multiple internal reﬂections, even if the fibre is bent. 3. Cartesian sign convention: Distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are positive; those measured in the opposite direction are negative. All distances are measured from the pole / optic centre of the mirror / lens on the principal axis. The heights measured upwards above x—axis and normal to the principal axis of the mirror / lens are taken as positive. The heights measured downwards are taken as negative. 2019-20 341",0

Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the progression of a restriction enzyme digestion. DNA is a negatively charged molecule, hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode) (Figure 1 1.3). The process is repeated with the vector DNA also. The joining of DNA involves several processes. After having cut the source DNA as well as the vector DNA with a speciﬁc restriction enzyme, the cut out ‘gene of interest’ from the source DNA and the cut vector with space are mixed and ligase is added. This results in the preparation of recombinant DNA. 1 1.3.3 Ampliﬁcation of Gene of Interest using PCR PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction.

(13) Polar molecules. 72 different permanent dipoles are oriented randomly due to thermal agitation; so the total dipole moment is zero. When an external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend to align with the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net dipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is polarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of two mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external ﬁeld tending to align the dipoles with the ﬁeld and thermal energy tending to disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the ‘induced dipole moment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment effect is more important for polar molecules. Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops a net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole moment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P.

Along with genomic control and extrinsic factors, they play an important role in plant growth and development. Many of the extrinsic factors such as temperature and light, control plant growth and development via PGR. Some of such events could be: vernalisation, ﬂowering, dormancy, seed germination, plant movements, etc. We shall discuss brieﬂy the role of light and temperature (both of them, the extrinsic factors) on initiation of ﬂowering. 15.5 PHOTOPERIODISM It has been observed that some plants require a periodic exposure to light to induce ﬂowering. It is also seen that such plants are able to measure the duration of exposure to light. For example, some plants require the exposure to light for a period exceeding a well deﬁned critical duration, while others must be exposed to light for a period less than this critical duration before the ﬂowering is initiated in them. The former group of plants are called long day plants while the latter ones are termed short day plants. The critical duration is different for different plants. There are many plants, however, where there is no such correlation between exposure to light duration and induction of ﬂowering response; such plants are called day-neutral plants (Figure 15.12).

Anything thrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot more tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds above fall towards the earth and there are many other such phenomena. Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo (1564- l 642) who recognised the fact that all bodies, irrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth with a constant acceleration. It is said that he made a public demonstration of this fact. To find the truth, he certainly did experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and arrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is close to the more accurate value obtained later. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars, planets and their motion has been the subject of attention in many countries since the earliest of times. Observations since early times recognised stars which appeared in the sky with positions unchanged year after year. The more interesting objects are the planets which seem to have regular motions against the background of stars. The earliest recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy about 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ model in which all celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved around the earth. The only motion that was thought to be possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle. Complicated schemes of motion were put forward by Ptolemy in order to describe the observed motion of the planets. The planets were described as moving in circles with the centre of the circles themselves moving in larger circles. Similar theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some 400 years later. However a more elegant model in which the Sun was the centre around which the planets revolved — the ‘heliocentric’ model — was already mentioned by Aryabhatta (5th century AD.) in his treatise.

372,1161,"Normal Hb (A) gene BIOLOGY the gene has a 50 per cent chance of being colour blind. The mother is not herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. That means that its effect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene. A daughter will not normally be colour blind, unless her mother is a carrier and her father is colour blind. Haemophilia : This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its transmission from unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny has been widely studied. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of the cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to this, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding. The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease to sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely rare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the father should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family pedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents as she was a carrier of the disease. Sickle-cell anaemia : This is an autosome linked recessive trait that can be transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The disease is controlled by a single pair of allele, HbA and HbS. Out of the three possible genotypes only homozygous individuals for HbS (HbsHbS) show the diseased phenotype. Heterozygous (HbAHbS) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they are carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission of the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait (Figure 5.15).

373,1066,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS distribution. The proportion of different age groups of males and females in a population is often presented graphically as age pyramid; its shape indicates whether a population is stationary, growing or declining. Ecological effects of any factors on a population are generally reﬂected in its size (population density), which may be expressed in different ways (numbers, biomass, per cent cover, etc.,) depending on the species. Populations grow through births and immigration and decline through deaths and emigration. When resources are unlimited, the growth is usually exponential but when resources become progressively limiting, the growth pattern turns logistic. In either case, growth is ultimately limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is a measure of the inherent potential of a population to grow. In nature populations of different species in a habitat do not live in isolation but interact in many ways. Depending on the outcome, these interactions between two species are classified as competition (both species suffer), predation and parasitism (one beneﬁts and the other suffers), commensalism (one benefits and the other is unaffected), amensalism (one is harmed, other unaffected) and mutualism (both species benefit). Predation is a very important process through which trophic energy transfer is facilitated and some predators help in controlling their prey populations. Plants have evolved diverse morphological and chemical defenses against herbivory. In competition, it is presumed that the superior competitor eliminates the inferior one (the Competitive Exclusion Principle), but many closely related species have evolved various mechanisms which facilitate their co-existence. Some of the most fascinating cases of mutualism in nature are seen in plant-pollinator interactions. EXERCISES 1. How is diapause different from hibernation? 2.

374,1380,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 2.4 KINGDOM PLANTAE Kingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms commonly called plants. A few members are partially heterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwort and Venus ﬂy trap are examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta is a parasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominent chloroplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. You will study the eukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Life cycle of plants has two distinct phases — the diploid sporophytic and the haploid gametophytic — that alternate with each other. The lengths of the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free— living or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants. This phenomenon is called alternation of generation. You will study further details of this kingdom in Chapter 3. 2.5 KINGDOM ANIMALIA This kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms that are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly or indirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internal cavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutrition is holozoic — by ingestion of food. They follow a deﬁnite grth pattern and grow into adults that have a deﬁnite shape and size. Higher forms show elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them are capable of locomotion. The sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followed by embryological development. Salient features of various phyla are described in Chapter 4. 2.6 VIRUSES, VIROIDS, PRIONs AND LICHENS In the ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation of Whittaker there is no mention of lichens and some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These are brieﬂy introduced here. All of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘ﬂu’ know what effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with our condition. Viruses did not ﬁnd a place in classiﬁcation since they are not considered truly ‘living’, if we understand lian as those organisms that have a cell structure. The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are characterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the lian cell. 25",1
375,226,"238 PHYSICS is known as hydraulic stress and in magnitude is equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force per unit area). The strain produced by a hydraulic pressure is called volume strain and is defined as the ratio of change in volume (AV) to the original volume (V). A_V V Since the strain is a ratio of change in dimension to the original dimension, it has no units or dimensional formula. Volume strain = (9.5) 9.4 HOOKE'S LAW Stress and strain take different forms in the situations depicted in the Fig. (9.2). For small deformations the stress and strain are proportional to each other. This is known as Hooke’s law. Thus, stress o< strain stress = k x strain (9.6) where k is the proportionality constant and is known as modulus of elasticity. Hooke’s law is an empirical law and is found to be valid for most materials. However, there are some materials which do not exhibit this linear relationship. 9.5 STRESS-STRAIN CURVE The relation between the stress and the strain for a given material under tensile stress can be found experimentally. In a standard test of tensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is stretched by an applied force. The fractional change in length (the strain) and the applied force needed to cause the strain are recorded. The applied force is gradually increased in steps and the change in length is noted. A graph is plotted between the stress (which is equal in magnitude to the applied force per unit area) and the strain produced. A typical graph for a metal is shown in Fig. 9.3. Analogous graphs for compression and shear stress may also be obtained. The stress-strain curves vary from material to material. These curves help us to understand how a given material deforms with increasing loads. From the graph, we can see that in the region between 0 to A, the curve is linear. In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed. 2019-20 The body regains its original dimensions when the applied force is removed. In this region, the solid behaves as an elastic body. Fracture B I point A I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I A[fl/Permanent set . 30% <1% Straln —> Fig. 9.3 A typical stress—strain curve for a metal. In the region from A to B, stress and strain are not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still returns to its original dimension when the load is removed. The point B in the curve is known as yield point (also known as elastic limit) and the corresponding stress is known as yield strength (0y) of the material. If the load is increased further, the stress developed exceeds the yield strength and strain increases rapidly even for a small change in the stress. The portion of the curve between B and D shows this. When the load is removed, say at some point C between B and D, the body does not regain its original dimension. In this case, even when the stress is zero, the strain is not zero. The material is said to have a permanent set. The deformation is said to be plastic deformation. The point D on the graph is the ultimate tensile strength (on) of the material. Beyond this point, additional strain is produced even by a reduced applied force and fracture occurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and fracture points D and E are close, the material is said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the material is said to be ductile. As stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour varies from material to material. For example, rubber can be pulled to several times its original length and still returns to its original shape. Fig. 9.4 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of aorta, present in the heart. Note that although elastic region is very large, the material",0

However, once formed, how the ﬁrst cellular forms of life could have evolved into the complex biodiversity of today is the fascinating story that will be discussed below. 7.2 EVOLUTION OF LIFE FORMS - A THEORY Conventional religious literature tells us about the theory of special creation. This theory has three connotations. One, that all living organisms (species or types) that we see today were created as such. Two, that the diversity was always the same since creation and will be the same in future also. Three, that earth is about 4000 years Old. All these ideas were strongly challenged during the nineteenth century. Based on Observations made during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the world, Charles Darwin concluded that existing living forms share similarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with life forms that existed millions of years ago. Many such life forms do not exist any more. There had been extinctions Of different life forms in the years gone by j ust as new forms of life arose at different periods of history of earth.

Would you call viruses living or non-living? The name virus that means venom or poisonous ﬂuid was given by Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892) recognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease of tobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteria because they passed through bacteria-proof ﬁlters. M.W. Beijerinek (1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of tobacco could cause infection in healthy plants and called the ﬂuid as Contagium vivumﬂuidum (infectious living ﬂuid). W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that Viruses could be crystallised and crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their speciﬁc host cell. Viruses are obligate parasites. In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could be either RNA or DNA. No virus contains both RNA and DNA. A virus is a nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses that infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals have either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA. Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are usually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat called capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the nucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral geometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like mumps, small pox, herpes and inﬂuenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the symptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing and vein clearing, dwarﬂng and stunted growth. 201 9-2020",1

It implies that if the sum of all debits equals the sum of all credits, it is presumed that the posting to the ledger in terms of debit and credit amounts is accurate. The trial balance is a tool for verifying the correctness of debit and credit amounts. It is an arithmetical check under the double entry system which veriﬁes that both aspects of every transaction have been recorded accurately. This chapter explains the meaning and process of preparation of trial balance and the types of errors and their rectification. 6.1 Meaning of Trial Balance A trial balance is a statement showing the balances, or total of debits and credits, of all the accounts in the ledger with a view to verify the arithmatical accuracy of posting into the ledger accounts. Trial balance is an important statement in the accounting process as it shows the final position of all accounts and helps in preparing the final statements. The task of preparing the statements is simplified because the accountant can take the balances of all accounts from the trial balance instead of going through the whole ledger. It may be noted that the trial balance is usually prepared with the balances of accounts. 2019-2020",3

This implies that greater the frequency of incident light, greater is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. Consequently, we need greater retarding potential to stop them completely. If we plot a graph between the frequency of incident radiation and the corresponding stopping potential for different metals we get a straight line, as shown in Fig. 1 1.5.

(ii) there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency v0 for which the stopping potential is zero. These observations have two implications: (i) The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity. (ii) For a frequency v of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off frequency v0, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the intensity is large. This minimum, cut-off frequency v0, is called the threshold frequency. It is different for different metals. Different photosensitive materials respond diiferently to light. Selenium is more sensitive than zinc or copper. The same photosensitive substance gives different response to light of different wavelengths. For example, ultraviolet light gives rise to photoelectric effect in copper while green or red light does not. Note that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of the incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric emission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if the incident radiation is very dim. It is now known that emission starts in a time of the order of 10‘9 s or less. We now summarise the experimental features and observations described in this section. (i) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation (above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig. 1 1.2). (ii) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation, saturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of incident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of its intensity (Fig. 1 1.3).

384,1233,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS 187 rates, up to l 5 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A long standing question is, whether water is ‘pushed’ or ‘pulled’ through the plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly ‘pulled’ through the plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from the leaves. This is referred to as the cohesion-tension-transpiration pull model of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull? Water is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching the leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth. Most of it is lost through the stomata in the leaves. This water loss is known as transpiration. You have studied transpiration in an earlier class by enclosing a healthy plant in polythene bag and observing the droplets of water formed inside the bag. You could also study water loss from a leaf using cobalt chloride paper, which turns colour on absorbing water. 1 1 .4 TRANSPIRATION Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through these stomata. Normally stomata are open in the day time and close during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore or stomatal aperture, is thick and elastic. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells ﬂanking each stomatal aperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose rnicrofibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier for the stoma to open. When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss (or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard cells become ﬂaccid and the stoma closes. Usually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf has a greater number of stomata while in an isobilateral (often monocotyledonous) leaf they are about equal on both surfaces. Transpiration is affected by several external factors: temperature, light, MiCFOﬁbn'lS humidity, wind speed. Plant factors that Guard cell affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, per cent of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc. Stomatal aperture Figure11.8 A stomatal aperture with guard cells 2019-2020",1

Forces Affecting the Velocity and Direction of Wind You already know that the air is set in motion due to the differences in atmospheric pressure. The air in motion is called wind. The wind blows from high pressure to low pressure. The wind at the surface experiences friction. In addition, rotation of the earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force. Thus, the horizontal winds near the earth surface respond to the combined effect of three forces — the pressure gradient force, the frictional force and the Coriolis force. In addition, the gravitational force acts downward. Pressure Gradient Force The differences in atmospheric pressure produces a force. The rate of change of pressure with respect to distance is the pressure gradient. The pressure gradient is strong where the isobars are close to each other and is weak where the isobars are apart. Frictional Force It affects the speed of the wind. It is greatest at the surface and its inﬂuence generally extends upto an elevation of l - 3 km. Over the sea surface the friction is minimal. Coriolis Force The rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in 1844.

There is, however, a clear symmetry in the problem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of the network. The paths AA’, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the network. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further, at the corners A’, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally into the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all the 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using Kirchhoﬂ‘s first rule and the symmetry in the problem. Next take a closed loop, say, ABCC’EA, and apply Kirchhoffs second rule: —IR — (1/2)IR— IR + 8= 0 where R is the resistance of each edge and 8 the emf of battery.

It should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the great power of Kirchhoff s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.6. In a general network, there will be no such simplification due symmetry, and only by application of Kirchhoff s rules to junctions and closed loops (as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we handle the problem.

391,558,"EE El % Chapter Six ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 6. 1 INTRODUCTION Electricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated phenomena for a long time. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others established the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They found that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example, an electric current deﬂects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity. This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible? Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit such a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is resounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and Joseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1 830, demonstrated conclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when subjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the phenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand the underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is generated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called electromagnetic induction. When Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion between a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the latter, he was asked, “What is the use of it. ” His reply was: “What is the use of a new born baby?” The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction 2019-20",0

Why does it happen ? This is because the air drag and the friction at the support oppose the motion of the pendulum and dissipate its energy gradually. The pendulum is said to execute damped oscillations. In dampled oscillations, the energy of the system is dissipated continuously; but, for small damping, the oscillations remain approximately periodic. The dissipating forces are generally the frictional forces. To understand the effect of such external forces on the motion of an oscillator, let us consider a system as shown in Fig. 14.19. Here a block of mass m connected to an elastic spring of spring constant k oscillates vertically. If the block is pushed down a little and released, its angular frequency of k oscillation is (0: a , as seen in Eq. (14.20). However, in practice, the surrounding medium (air) will exert a damping force on the motion of the block and the mechanical energy of the block-spring system will decrease. The energy loss will appear as heat of the surrounding medium (and the block also) [Fig. 14.19]. x Rigid support Spring BI9'Ck ..-.-.:.- .32: ' Surrounding ‘ -, medium ._ x' Fig. 1 4. 1 9 The viscous surrounding medium exerts a damping force on an oscillating spring, eventually bringing it to rest. 2019-20",0

What fraction of a sample of pure tritium will remain undecayed after 25 y. Solution By definition of half-life, half of the initial sample will remain undecayed after 12.5 y. In the next 125 y, one-half of these nuclei would have decayed. Hence, one fourth of the sample of the initial pure tritium will remain undecayed. 13.6.2 Alpha decay A well-known example of alpha decay is the decay of uranium 2S’SUto thorium 233 Th with the emission of a helium nucleus 3 He 2§§U —> 233111 + 3 He (cc-decay) (I 3.1 9) In oc-decay, the mass number of the product nucleus (daughter nucleus) is four less than that of the decaying nucleus (parent nucleus), while the atomic number decreases by two. In general, oc-decay of a parent nucleus 2X results in a daughter nucleus :‘gY 2x » 1::Y + :He “3-20) From Einstein’s mass-energy equivalance relation [Eq. (13.6)] and energy conservation, it is clear that this spontaneous decay is possible only when the total mass of the decay products is less than the mass of the initial nucleus. This difference in mass appears as kinetic energy of the products. By referring to a table of nuclear masses, one can check that the total mass of 233111 and 3He is indeed less than that of 2§§U.

This is what happens in the games of marbles, carrom and billiards. In our everyday world, collisions take place only when two bodies touch each other. But consider a comet coming from far distances to the sun, or alpha particle coming towards a nucleus and going away in some direction. Here we have to deal with forces involving action at a distance. Such an event is called scattering. The velocities and directions in which the two particles go away depend on their initial velocities as well as the type of interaction between them, their masses, shapes and sizes. SUM'MARY i.

In contrast to conductors, they have no (or negligible number of) charge carriers. Recall from Section 2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an external electric ﬁeld. The free charge carriers move and charge distribution in the conductor adjusts itself in such a way that the electric ﬁeld due to induced charges opposes the external field within the conductor. This happens until, in the static situation, the two ﬁelds cancel each other and the net electrostatic ﬁeld in the conductor is zero. In a dielectric, this free movement of charges is not possible. It turns out that the external ﬁeld induces dipole moment by stretching or re-orienting molecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all the molecular dipole moments is net charges on the surface of the dielectric which produce a ﬁeld that opposes the external ﬁeld. Unlike in a conductor, however, the opposing field so induced does not exactly cancel the external ﬁeld. It only reduces it. The extent of the effect depends on the nature of the dielectric. To understand the effect, we need to look at the charge . _ _ distribution of a dielectric at the Non-Polar g ‘- molecular level. "" The molecules of a substance may be polar or non-polar. In a non-polar molecule, the centres of positive and negative charges coincide. The molecule then has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole moment.

On the I other hand, a polar molecule is one in which _ 7 7 7 the centres of positive and negative charges H01 are separated (even when there is no external field). Such molecules have a permanent dipole moment.

The entire process of response to a peripheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without conscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the central nervous system is called a reﬂex action. The reﬂex pathway comprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector or excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 2 1.5). The afferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the impulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord). The efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The stimulus and response thus forms a reﬂex arc as shown below in the knee jerk reﬂex. You should carefully study Figure 2 1.5 to understand the mechanism of a knee jerk reﬂex.

Out-breeding : Out-breeding is the breeding of the unrelated animals, which may be between individuals of the same breed but having no common ancestors for 4-6 generations (out-crossing) or between different breeds (cross-breeding) or different species (inter-specific hybridisation) . Out-crossing: This is the practice of mating of animals within the same breed, but having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree up to 4-6 generations. The offspring of such a mating is known as an out-cross. It is the best breeding method for animals that are below average in productivity in milk production, growth rate in beef cattle, etc. A single outcross often helps to overcome inbreeding depression. Cross-breeding: In this method, superior males of one breed are mated with superior females of another breed. Cross-breeding allows the desirable qualities of two different breeds to be combined. The progeny hybrid animals may themselves be used for commercial production. Alternatively, they may be subjected to some form of inbreeding and selection to develop new stable breeds that may be superior to the existing breeds. Many new animal breeds have been developed by this approach. Hisardale is a new breed of sheep developed in Punjab by crossing Bikaneri ewes and Marino rams. Interspecific hybridisation: In this method, male and female animals of two different related species are mated. In some cases, the progeny may combine desirable features of both the parents, and may be of considerable economic value, e.g., the mule (Figure 9.2). Do you know what cross leads to the production of the mule? Controlled breeding experiments are carried out using artiﬁcial insemination. The semen is collected from the male that is chosen as a parent and injected into the reproductive tract of the selected female by the breeder. The semen may be used immediately or can be frozen and used at a later date. It can also be transported in a frozen form to where the female is housed. In this way desirable matings are carried. Artiﬁcial insemination helps us overcome several problems of normal matings. Can you discuss and list some of them? Often, the success rate of crossing mature male and Figure 9-2 M1116 female animals is fairly low even though artificial insemination is carried out.

402,1164,"PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION SUMMARY Genetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance and its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and physiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists. Mendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While studying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting characters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are today referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that the ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found in pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the characters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in different—first generations (F1), second (F2) and so on. Some characters are dominant over others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are in heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters are only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never blend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not expressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it becomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of gametes (Law of Segregation). Not all characters show true dominance. Some characters show incomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the inheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors independently assort and combine in all permutations and combinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations of gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known as ‘Punnett Square’. The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes regulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical expression of the chraracters is called phenotype. After knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a good correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were extended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it was found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold true for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These genes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted together, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted independently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement of genes on a chromosome. Many genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked genes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of chromosomes which were common, and another set which was different. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were named as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as autosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in male are ZZ, and in females are ZW. Mutation is defined as change in the genetic material. A point mutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is caused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of hemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a pedigree of a family.

404,919,"BIOLOGY (b) Figure 7.4 Figure showing white - winged moth and dark - winged moth (melanised) 132 on a tree trunk (a) In unpolluted area (b) In polluted area The explanation put forth for this observation was that ‘predators will spot a moth against a contrasting background’. During post- industrialisation period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial smoke and soots. Under this condition the white-winged moth did not survive due to predators, dark-winged or melanised moth survived. Before industrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen covered the trees - in that background the white winged moth survived but the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators. Do you know that lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators? They will not grow in areas that are polluted. Hence, moths that were able to camouﬂage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived (Figure 7 .4). This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas where industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of melanic moths was low. This showed that in a mixed population, those that can better-adapt, survive and increase in population size. Remember that no variant is completely wiped out. Similarly, excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc., has only resulted in selection of resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale. This is also true for microbes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against eukaryotic organisms / cell. Hence, resistant organisms / cells are appearing in a time scale of months or years and not centuries. These are examples of evolution by anthropogenic action. This also tells us that evolution is not a directed process in the sense of determinism. It is a stochastic process based on chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms. 7.4 WHAT Is ADAPTIVE RADIATION? During his journey Darwin went to Galapagos Islands.

405,767,"382 i Physics is the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well known laws of reﬂection and refraction. 3. The principle of superposition of waves applies whenever two or more sources of light illuminate the same point. When we consider the intensity of light due to these sources at the given point, there is an interference term in addition to the sum of the individual intensities. But this term is important only if it has a non—zero average, which occurs only if the sources have the same frequency and a stable phase difference. 4. Young’s double slit of separation 01 gives equally spaced fringes of angular separation l/d. The source, mid—point of the slits, and central bright fringe lie in a straight line. An extended source will destroy the fringes if it subtends angle more than 1/ d at the slits. 5. A single slit of width a gives a diffraction pattern with gzcentral maximum. The intensity falls to zero at angles of ia’i?’ etc., with successively weaker secondary maxima in between. Diffraction limits the angular resolution of a telescope to II/ D where D is the diameter. Two stars closer than this give strongly overlapping images. Similarly, a microscope objective subtending angle Zﬁ at the focus, in a medium of refractive index n, will just separate two objects spaced at a distance 1/ (2n sin [3), which is the resolution limit of a microscope. Diffraction determines the limitations of the concept of light rays. A beam of width (1 travels a distance a2 /1, called the Fresnel distance, before it starts to spread out due to diffraction. 6. Natural light, e. g., from the sun is unpolarised. This means the electric vector takes all possible directions in the transverse plane, rapidly and randomly, during a measurement. A polaroid transmits only one component [parallel to a special axis). The resulting light is called linearly polarised or plane polarised. When this kind of light is viewed through a second polaroid whose axis turns through 27:, two maxima and minima of intensity are seen. Polarised light can also be produced by reﬂection at a special angle [called the Brewster angle) and by scattering through 7t / 2 in the earth’s atmosphere. POINTS TO PONDER Waves from a point source spread out in all directions, while light was seen to travel along narrow rays. It required the insight and experiment of Huygens, Young and Fresnel to understand how a wave theory could explain all aspects of the behaviour of light. The crucial new feature of waves is interference of amplitudes from different sources which can be both constructive and destructive, as shown in Young’s experiment. Diffraction phenomena define the limits of ray optics. The limit of the ability of microscopes and telescopes to distinguish very close objects is set by the wavelength of light. Most interference and diffraction effects exist even for longitudinal waves like sound in air. But polarisation phenomena are special to transverse waves like light waves. 2019-20",0

Each of the peripheral ﬁbril is a triplet.The adjacent triplets are also linked. The central part of the proximal region of the centriole is also proteinaceous and called the hub, which is connected with tubules of the peripheral triplets by radial spokes made of protein. The centrioles form the basal body of cilia or ﬂagella, and spindle fibres that give rise to spindle apparatus during cell division in animal cells. 8.5. 10 Nucleus Nucleus as a cell organelle was ﬁrst described by Robert Brown as early as 1 83 1. Later the material of the nucleus stained by the basic dyes was given the name chromatin by Fleming. The interphase nucleus (nucleus of a cell when it is not dividing) has highly extended and elaborate nucleoprotein ﬁbres called chromatin, nuclear matrix and one or more spherical bodies called nucleoli (sing: nucleolus) (Figure 8.1 1). Electron microscopy has revealed that the nuclear envelope, which consists of two parallel membranes with a space between (10 to 50 nm) called the perinuclear Nuaear space, forms a barrier between the membrane materials present inside the nucleus and that of the cytoplasm. The outer membrane usually remains continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and also bears ribosomes on it. At a number of places the nuclear envelope is interrupted by minute pores, which are formed by the fusion of its two membranes. These nuclear pores are the passages through which movement of RNA and protein molecules takes place in both directions between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Normally, there is only one nucleus per cell, variations in the number of nuclei are also frequently observed. Can you recollect names of organisms that have more than one nucleus per cell? Some mature cells even lack nucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells of vascular plants. Would you consider these cells as ‘living’? The nuclear matrix or the nucleoplasm contains nucleolus and chromatin. The nucleoli are spherical structures present in the nucleoplasm. The content of nucleolus is continuous with the rest of the nucleoplasm as it is not a membrane bound structure. It is a site for active ribosomal RNA synthesis. Larger and more numerous nucleoli are present in cells actively carrying out protein synthesis. Nucleoplasm Nucleolus Nuclear pore",1

Between period t = 18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly decreasing and during the period t= 0 s to t = 10 s, it is increasing. Note that for uniform motion, velocity is the same as the average velocity at all instants. Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of + 24.0 m S'1 and a velocity of— 24.0 m S'1 — both have an associated speed of 24.0 m s4. It should be noted that though average speed over a finite interval of time is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity, instantaneous speed at an instant is equal to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at that instant. Why so ? 3.5 ACCELERATION The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. How to describe this change? Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time ? This was a problem even in Galileo’s time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance. But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant — it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. Average velocity = = 6.0><b This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with time. The average acceleration 6 over a time interval is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time interval : ”2‘01 _ﬂ t2—tl At where v2 and D1 are the instantaneous velocities or simply velocities at time t2 and t1 .

What is the pressure required in the tube in order to blow a hemispherical bubble at its end in water? The surface tension of water at temperature of the experiments is 7.30><10'2 Nm‘l. l atmospheric pressure = 1.01 X 105 Pa. density ofwater = 1000 kg/m“. g = 9.80 m s2. Also calculate the excess pressure. AnswerThe excess pressure in a bubble of gas in a liquid is given by 28/ r, where S is the surface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You should note there is only one liquid surface in this case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there are two liquid surfaces, so the formula for excess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The radius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure outside the bubble P0 equals atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of water column. That is P0 = (1.01 X 105 Pa + 0.08 m X 1000 kg m‘3 X 9.80 m S'Z) = 1.01784 X 105 Pa Therefore, the pressure inside the bubble is Pi = P0 + ZS/r = 1.01784X 105 Pa+ (2 X 7.3 X 10'2 Pa m/ 10'3 m) = (1.01784 + 0.00146) X 105 Pa = 1.02 X 105 Pa where the radius of the bubble is taken to be equal to the radius of the capillary tube, since the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer has been rounded off to three significant figures.) The excess pressure in the bubble is 146 Pa. 4 SUMNIARY 1. The basic property of a ﬂuid is that it can ﬂow. The ﬂuid does not have any resistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a ﬂuid is governed by the shape of its container. 2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible and it expands to occupy all the space available to it. 3. If F is the normal force exerted by a ﬂuid on an area A then the average pressure Pav is defined as the ratio of the force to area P..=— A 4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m’z. Other common units of pressure are 1 atm = 1.01X105 Pa 1 bar = 105 Pa 1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa 1 mm ong = 1 torr = 133 Pa 5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a ﬂuid at rest is same at all points which are at the same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed ﬂuid is transmitted undiminished to every point of the ﬂuid and the walls of the containing vessel. 6. The pressure in a ﬂuid varies with depth h according to the expression P=Pa+pgh where p is the density of the ﬂuid, assumed uniform. 7. The volume of an incompressible ﬂuid passing any point every second in a pipe of non uniform crossection is the same in the steady ﬂow. 1) A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection) The equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow. 2019-20",0

Such individuals are called Rh positive (Rh+ve) and those in whom this antigen is absent are called Rh negative mh-ve). An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form speciﬁc antibodies against the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched before transfusions. A special case of Rh incompatibility (mismatching) has been observed between the Rh-ve blood of a pregnant mother with Rh+ve blood of the foetus. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to the Rh-ve blood of the mother in the ﬁrst pregnancy as the two bloods are well separated by the placenta. However, during the delivery of the ﬁrst child, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood to small amounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. In such cases, the mother starts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood. In case of her subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from the mother (Rh-ve) can leak into the blood of the foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy the foetal RBCs. This could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and jaundice to the baby. This condition is called erythroblastosis foetalis. This can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother immediately after the delivery of the ﬁrst child. 18. 1.4 Coagulation of Blood You know that when you cut your ﬁnger or hurt yourself, your wound does not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops ﬂowing after sometime. Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting in response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark reddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period of time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads called ﬁbrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive ﬁbrinogens in the plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from another inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade process) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive state. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain factors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate coagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting.",1

Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the spectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is mainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret the world around us. There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second, that it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that the speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value in vacuum is c = 2.99792458 X 108 m s‘l. For many purposes, it suffices to take c = 3 X 108 m s‘l. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest speed attainable in nature. The intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to contradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an electromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the spectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the wavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects that we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger). In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be considered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining 2019-20",0

The crista and macula are the speciﬁc receptors of the vestibular apparatus responsible for maintenance of balance of the body and posture. 20.6.2.1 Mechanism of Hearing How does ear convert sound waves into neural impulses, which are sensed and processed by the brain enabling us to recognise a sound ? The external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum. The ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations are transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to the oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on to the ﬂuid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The waves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These movements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them against the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated in the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by the afferent ﬁbres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain, where the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised. SUMMARY The neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic and homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of neural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of ions across the membrane. The elT‘levglrical potential difference across the resting neural membrane is called the, ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted along the axon membrgim ‘ in the form of a wave of depolarisation and repolarisation. A synap‘é’e‘i’s formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical synapses are called neurotransmitters.

The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain and (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus.

416,795,"BIOLOGY shows that extinctions across taxa are not random; some groups like amphibians appear to be more vulnerable to extinction. Adding to the grim scenario of extinctions is the fact that more than 15,500 species world-wide are facing the threat of extinction. Presently, 12 per cent of all bird species, 23 per cent of all mammal species, 32 per cent of all amphibian species and 3 1per cent of all gimnosperm species in the world face the threat of extinction. From a study of the history of life on earth through fossil records, we learn that large-scale loss of species like the one we are currently witnessing have also happened earlier, even before humans appeared on the scene. During the long period (> 3 billion years) since the origin and diversiﬁcation of life on earth there were ﬁve episodes of mass extinction of species. How is the ‘Sixth Extinction’ presently in progress different from the previous episodes? The difference is in the rates; the current species extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times faster than in the pre-human times and our activities are responsible for the faster rates. Ecologists warn that if the present trends continue, nearly half of all the species on earth might be wiped out within the next 100 years. In general, loss of biodiversity in a region may lead to (a) decline in plant production, (b) lowered resistance to environmental perturbations such as drought and (0) increased variability in certain ecosystem processes such as plant productivity, water use, and pest and disease cycles. Causes of biodiversity losses: The accelerated rates of species extinctions that the world is facing now are largely due to human activities. There are four major causes (‘The Evil Quartet’ is the sobriquet used to describe them). (i) Habitat loss and fragmentation: This is the most important cause driving animals and plants to extinction. The most dramatic examples of habitat loss come from tropical rain forests. Once covering more than 14 per cent of the earth’s land surface, these rain forests now cover no more than 6 per cent. They are being destroyed fast. By the time you ﬁnish reading this chapter, 1000 more hectares of rain forest would have been lost. The Amazon rain forest (it is so huge that it is called the ‘lungs of the planet’) harbouring probably millions of species is being cut and cleared for cultivating soya beans or for conversion to grasslands for raising beef cattle. Besides total loss, the degradation of many habitats by pollution also threatens the survival of many species. When large habitats are broken up into small fragments due to various human activities, mammals and birds requiring large territories and certain animals with migratory habits are badly affected, leading to population declines.

417,156,"92 PHYSICS Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642) Galileo Galilei. born in Pisa, Italy in 1564 was a key figure in the scientiﬁc revolution in Europe about four centuries ago. Galileo proposed the concept of acceleration. From experiments on motion of bodies on inclined planes or falling freely. he contradicted the Aristotelian notion that a force was required to keep a body in motion. and that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter bodies under gravity. He thus arrived at the law of inertia that was the starting point of the subsequent epochal work of Isaac Newton. Galileo's discoveries in astronomy were equally revolutionary. In 1609. he designed his own telescope (invented earlier in Holland) and used it to make a number of startling observations : mountains and depressions on the surface of the moon: dark spots on the sun: the moons of J upiter and the phases of Venus. He concluded that the Milky Way derived its luminosity because of a large number of stars not visible to the naked eye. In his masterpiece of scientiﬁc reasoning : Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo advocated the heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Copernicus. which eventually got universal acceptance. With Galileo came a turning point in the very method of scientiﬁc inquiry. Science was no longer merely observations of nature and inferences from them. Science meant devising and doing experiments to verify or refute theories. Science meant measurement of quantities and a search for mathematical relations between them. Not undeservedly. many regard Galileo as the father of modern science. More often, however, we do not know all the forces to begin with. In that case, if we know that an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either at rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer from the ﬁrst law that the net external force on the object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere. For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every object experiences gravitational force due to the earth. Also objects in motion generally experience friction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an object is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out i.e. add up to zero net external force. Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface Fig. (5.2(a)). It is subject to two external forces : the force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting downward and the upward force on the book by the table, the normal force R . Ris a self-adjusting force. This is an example of the kind of situation mentioned above. The forces are not quite known fully but the state of motion is known. We observe the book to be at rest. Therefore, we conclude from the first law that the magnitude of R equals that of W. A statement often encountered is : “Since W= R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book is at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct statement is : “Since the book is observed to be at rest, the net external force on it must be zero, according to the ﬁrst law. This implies that the 2019-20 normal force R must be equal and opposite to the weight W (a) (b) Fig. 5.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car moving with uniform velocity. The net force is zero in each case. Consider the motion of a car starting from rest, picking up speed and then moving on a smooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig. (5.2(b)). When the car is stationary, there is no net force acting on it. During pick-up, it accelerates. This must happen due to a net external force. Note, it has to be an external force. The acceleration of the car cannot be accounted for by any internal force. This might sound surprising, but it is true. The only conceivable external force along the road is the force of friction. It is the frictional force that accelerates the car as a whole. (You will learn about friction in section 5.9). When the car moves with constant velocity, there is no net external force.",0

Hence, energy required to take out an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energr Eg) will be least for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free electrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly small for C. 14.4 EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its temperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As such, no important electronic devices can be developed using these semiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their conductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities. When a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable impurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the semiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as extrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors. The deliberate addition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms are called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor. The dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure semiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original semiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain this is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should be nearly the same. There are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si or Ge: (i) Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous (P), etc. 2019-20",0

421,639,"Seeing is Believing Can one see atoms rushing about. Almost but not quite. One can see pollen grains of a ﬂower being pushed around by molecules of water. The size of the grain is ~ 10’5 m. In 1827, a Scottish botanist Robert Brown. while examining. under a microscope. pollen grains of a ﬂower suspended in water noticed that they continuously moved about in a zigzag. random fashion. Kinetic theory provides a simple explanation of the phenomenon. Any object suspended in water is continuously bombarded from all sides by the water molecules. Since the motion of molecules is random, the number of molecules hitting the object in any direction is about the same as the number hitting in the opposite direction. The small difference between these molecular hits is negligible compared to the total number of hits for an object of ordinary size. and we do not notice any movement of the object. When the object is sufficiently small but still visible under a microscope, the difference in molecular hits from different directions is not altogether negligible. i.e. the impulses and the torques given to the suspended object through continuous bombardment by the molecules of the medium [water or some other ﬂuid) do not exactly sum to zero. There is a net impulse and torque in this or that direction. The suspended object thus, moves about in a zigzag manner and tumbles about randomly. This motion called now ‘Brownian motion” is a visible proof of molecular activity. In the last 50 years or so molecules have been seen by scanning tunneling and other special microscopes. [n 1987 Ahmed Zewail. an Egyptian scientist working in USA was able to observe not only the molecules but also their detailed interactions.

422,1459,"WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE the temperature of the air is reduced to dew point with its volume remaining constant; (ii) when both the volume and the temperature are reduced; (iv) when moisture is added to the air through evaporation. However, the most favourable condition for condensation is the decrease in air temperature. After condensation the water vapour or the moisture in the atmosphere takes one of the following forms — dew, frost, fog and clouds. Forms of condensation can be classiﬁed on the basis of temperature and location. Condensation takes place when the dew point is lower than the freezing point as well as higher than the freezing point. Dew When the moisture is deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in air above the surface) such as stones, grass blades and plant leaves, it is known as dew. The ideal conditions for its formation are clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and cold and long nights. For the formation of dew, it is necessary that the dew point is above the freezing point. Frost Frost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place below freezing point (0°C), i.e. the dew point is at or below the freezing point. The excess moisture is deposited in the form of minute ice crystals instead of water droplets. The ideal conditions for the formation of white frost are the same as those for the formation of dew, except that the air temperature must be at or below the freezing point. Fog and Mist When the temperature of an air mass containing a large quantity of water vapour falls all of a sudden, condensation takes place within itself on ﬁne dust particles. So, the fog is a cloud with its base at or very near to the ground. Because of the fog and mist, the visibility becomes poor to zero. In urban and industrial centres smoke provides plenty of nuclei which help the formation of fog and mist. Such a 95 condition when fog is mixed with smoke, is described as smog. The only difference between the mist and fog is that mist contains more moisture than the fog. In mist each nuceli contains a thicker layer of moisture. Mists are frequent over mountains as the rising warm air up the slopes meets a cold surface. Fogs are drier than mist and they are prevalent where warm currents of air come in contact with cold currents. Fogs are mini clouds in which condensation takes place around nuclei provided by the dust, smoke, and the salt particles. Clouds Cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or tiny crystals of ice formed by the condensation of the water vapour in free air at considerable elevations. As the clouds are formed at some height over the surface of the earth, they take various shapes. According to their height, expanse, density and transparency or opaqueness clouds are grouped under four types 2 (i) cirrus; (ii) cumulus; (iii) stratus; (iv) nimbus. Cirrus Cirrus clouds are formed at high altitudes (8,000 - 12,000m). They are thin and detatched clouds having a feathery appearance. They are always white in colour. Cumulus Cumulus clouds look like cotton wool. They are generally formed at a height of 4,000 - 7,000 m. They exist in patches and can be seen scattered here and there. They have a ﬂat base. Stratus As their name implies, these are layered clouds covering large portions of the sky. These clouds are generally formed either due to loss of heat or the mixing of air masses with different temperatures. Nimbus Nimbus clouds are black or dark gray. They form at middle levels or very near to the surface 2019-2020",2

425,127,"Duol Nature of Radiation and Mo’n‘er stopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall on the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted towards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons ﬂow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current ﬂow. Thus, light falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external circuit. Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with collector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light. Hallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a negatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope. He observed that the zinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. Further, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was irradiated by ultraviolet light. Positive charge on a positively charged zinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. From these observations he concluded that negatively charged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of ultraviolet light. After the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the incident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate. Due to negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector plate by the electric field. Hallwachs and Lenard also observed that when ultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all when the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain minimum value, called the threshold frequency. This minimum frequency depends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate. It was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc., responded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause electron emission from the surface. However, some alkali metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive even to visible light. All these photosensitive substances emit electrons when they are illuminated by light. After the discovery of electrons, these electrons were termed as photoelectrons. The phenomenon is called photoelectric effect. 11.4 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT Figure 1 1.1 depicts a schematic view of the arrangement used for the experimental study of the photoelectric effect. It consists of an evacuated glass / quartz tube having a photosensitive plate C and another metal plate A. Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short wavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive plate C (emitter). A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass tube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate the photosensitive plate C. The electrons are emitted by the plate C and are collected by the plate A (collector), by the electric field created by the battery. The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates C and A, that can be varied. The polarity of the plates C and A can be reversed by a commutator. Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired positive or negative potential with respect to emitter C. When the collector plate A is positive with respect to the emitter plate C, the electrons are 2019-20 |LU1L|’SI)lSAqd/SDQl0Jd/9]!S/PD‘SA3>1’MMM/ﬂduq L”. E E a; (D ""U (D :1.

Flagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-living or parasitic. They have ﬂagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such as sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma. Ciliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because of the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens to the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of cilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example: Paramoecium (Figure 2.4b). Sporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious spore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium (malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering effect on human population. 2.3 KINGDOM FUNGI The fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. They show a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You must have seen fungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat and toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due to a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e. g., yeast are used to make bread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat rust-causing Puccinia is an important example. Some are the source of antibiotics, e. g., Penicillium. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water, soil and on animals and plants. They prefer to grow in warm and humid places. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ‘? Yes, it is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections. With the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi are ﬁlamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures called hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae are continuous tubes ﬁlled with multinucleated cytoplasm — these are called coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their hyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides. Most fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter from dead substrates and hence are called saprophytes. Those that depend on living plants and animals are called parasites. They can also live as symbionts — in association with algae as lichens and with roots of higher plants as mycorrhiza. Reproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means — fragmentation, ﬁssion and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores",1

This is done to enable users to understand their nature and effect on the present and future cash ﬂows of an enterprise. Interest and Dividend In case of a ﬁnancial enterprise (whose main business is lending and borrowing), interest paid, interest received and dividend received are classiﬁed as operating activities while dividend paid is a ﬁnancing activity. In case of a non-ﬁnancial enterprise, as per AS—3, it is considered more appropriate that payment of interest and dividends are classified as ﬁnancing activities whereas receipt of interest and dividends are classiﬁed as investing activities. Taxes on Income and Gains Taxes may be income tax (tax on normal proﬁt), capital gains tax (tax on capital proﬁts), dividend tax (tax on the amount distributed as dividend to shareholders). AS—3 requires that cash ﬂows arising from taxes on income should be separately disclosed and should be classiﬁed as cash ﬂows from operating activities unless they can be speciﬁcally identified with ﬁnancing and investing activities.

Consider the equilibrium of the weight W. Clearly,T2 = 6 X 10 = 60 N. Consider the equilibrium of the point P under the action of three forces - the tensions T1 and T2, and the horizontal force 50 N.

The gravitational force is, of course, pervasive. Every object on the earth experiences the force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also governs the motion of celestial bodies. The gravitational force can act at a distance without the need of any intervening medium. All the other forces common in mechanics are contact forcesf'< As the name suggests, a contact force on an object arises due to contact with some other object: solid or ﬂuid. When bodies are in contact (e. g. a book resting on a table, a system of rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and kx mg other types of supports), there are mutual contact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying the third law. The component of contact force normal to the surfaces in contact is called normal reaction. The component parallel to the surfaces in contact is called friction. Contact forces arise also when solids are in contact with ﬂuids. For example, for a solid immersed in a ﬂuid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to the weight of the ﬂuid displaced. The viscous force, air resistance, etc are also examples of contact forces (Fig. 5.9). Two other common forces are tension in a string and the force due to spring. When a spring is compressed or extended by an external force, a restoring force is generated. This force is usually proportional to the compression or elongation (for small displacements). The spring force F is written as F = — k x where x is the displacement and k is the force constant. The negative sign denotes that the force is opposite to the displacement from the unstretched state. For an inextensible string, the force constant is very high. The restoring force in a string is called tension. It is customary to use a constant tension Tthroughout the string. This assumption is true for a string of negligible mass. In Chapter 1, we learnt that there are four fundamental forces in nature. Of these, the weak and strong forces appear in domains that do not concern us here. Only the gravitational and electrical forces are relevant in the context of mechanics. The different contact forces of mechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise from electrical forces. This may seem surprising Fig. 5.9 Some examples of contact forces in mechanics. * We are not considering, for simplicity, charged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, there are electrical and magnetic non—contact forces. 2019-20",0

We now realise that in earlier studies we assumed, without saying so, that rotational motion and/ or internal motion of the particles were either absent or negligible. We no longer need to do this. We have not only found the justification of the procedure we followed earlier; but we also have found how to describe and separate the translational motion of (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as well, or (2) a system of particles with all kinds of internal motion. Parabolic path of the projectile Explosion \ Path of the CM \ g \of fragments Fig. 7.12 The centre of mass of the fragments of the projectile continues along the same parabolic path which it would have followed if there were no explosion. Figure 7 .12 is a good illustration of Eq. (7 . 1 1). A projectile, following the usual parabolic trajectory, explodes into fragments midway in air. The forces leading to the explosion are internal forces. They contribute nothing to the motion of the centre of mass. The total external force, namely, the force of gravity acting on the body, is the same before and after the explosion. The centre of mass under the inﬂuence of the external force continues, therefore, along the same parabolic trajectory as it would have followed if there were no explosion. 7.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES Let us recall that the linear momentum of a particle is defined as p = m v (7 . 12) Let us also recall that Newton’s second law written in symbolic form for a single particle is dp F:— dt (7.13) where F is the force on the particle. Let us consider a system of n particles with masses m1, Tl respectively. The particles may be interacting and have external forces acting on them. The n12,...mn respectively and velocities v1 ,v2 , ....... v linear momentum of the first particle is mlv1 , of the second particle is m2v2 and so on. For the system of n particles, the linear momentum of the system is defined to be the vector sum of all individual particles of the system, P=p1+p2+...+pn =m1v1 +m2v2 +...+mnvn (7.14) Comparing this with Eq. (7 .8) P = M V (7 . 15) Thus, the total momentum of a system of particles is equal to the product of the total mass of the system and the velocity of its centre of mass. Differentiating Eq.

This is the law of conservation of the total linear momentum of a system of particles. Because of Eq.

(We assume throughout the discussion on systems of particles in this chapter that the total mass of the system remains constant.) Note that on account of the internal forces, i.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one another, the individual particles may have 0 or P = Constant (7.18a) 2019-20",0

When the orbit of a satellite becomes elliptic, both the K.E. and RE. vary from point to point. The total energy which remains constant is negative as in the circular orbit case. This is what we expect, since as we have discussed before if the total energy is positive or zero, the object escapes to infinity. Satellites are always at finite distance from the earth and hence their energies cannot be positive or zero. P.E=— E =K.E+P.E=— Example 8.8 A 400 kg satellite is in a circular orbit of radius 2RE about the Earth. How much energl is required to transfer it to a circular orbit of radius 4RE?

(8.37) becomes equal to 24 hours. If the circular orbit is in the equatorial plane of the earth, such a satellite, having the same period as the period of rotation of the earth about its own axis would appear stationery viewed from a point on earth. The (RE + h) for this purpose works out to be large as compared to RE : (8.43) T2GM “3 tar—E] 47!2 and for T= 24 hours, hworks out to be 35800 km. which is much larger than RE. Satellites in a circular orbits around the earth in the equatorial plane with T = 24 hours are called Geostationery Satellites. Clearly, since the earth rotates with the same period, the satellite would appear fixed from any point on earth. It takes very powerful rockets to throw up a satellite to such large heights above the earth but this has been done in view of the several benefits of many practical applications. Fig. 8.1 1 A Polar satellite. A strip on earth’s surface (shown shaded) is visible from the satellite during one cycle. For the next revolution of the satellite, the earth has rotated a little on its axis so that an adjacent strip becomes visible. It is known that electromagnetic waves above a certain frequency are not reﬂected from ionosphere. Radio waves used for radio broadcast which are in the frequency range 2 MHZ to 10 MHZ, are below the critical frequency. They are therefore reﬂected by the ionosphere.",0

We had discussed propagation of such waves in Chapter 15 of Class XI textbook. Since the displacement (which is along the y direction) is at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave, we have what is known as a transverse wave. Also, since the displacement is in the y direction, it is often referred to as a y-polarised wave. Since each point on the string moves on a straight line, the wave is also referred to as a linearly polarised wave. Further, the string always remains confined to the x—y plane and therefore it is also referred to as a plane polarised wave. In a similar manner we can consider the vibration of the string in the x-z plane generating a z—polarised wave whose displacement will be given by z(x,t) = asin (kx— wt) (10.34) It should be mentioned that the linearly polarised waves [described by Eqs. (10.33) and (10.34)] are all transverse waves; i.e., the displacement of each point of the string is always at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave. Finally, if the plane of vibration of the string is changed randomly in very short intervals of time, then we have what is known as an unpolarised wave. Thus, for an unpolarised wave the displacement will be randomly changing with time though it will always be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. A (10.33) Light waves are transverse in nature; i.e., the electric field associated with a propagating light wave is always at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave. This can be easily demonstrated using a simple polaroid. You must have seen thin plastic like sheets, which are called polaroids. A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a particular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating light wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed. Thus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then the light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating along a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules; this direction is known as the pass-axis of the polaroid. Thus, if the light from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) passes through a polaroid sheet P1, it is observed that its intensity is reduced by half. Rotating P1 has no effect on the transmitted beam and transmitted intensity remains constant. Now, let an identical piece of polaroid P2 be placed before P1. As expected, the light from the lamp is reduced in intensity on passing through P2 alone. But now rotating P1 has a dramatic effect on the light coming from P2. In one position, the intensity transmitted 2019-20 377",0
437,966,"STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS 7.4.2 Anatomy The alimentary canal present in the body cavity is divided into three regions: foregut, midgut and hindgut (Figure 7.16). The mouth opens into a short tubular pharynx, leading to a narrow tubular passage called oesophagus. This in turn opens into a sac like structure called crop used for storing of food. The crop is followed by gizzard or proventriculus. It has an outer layer of thick circular muscles and thick inner cuticle forming six highly chitinous plate called teeth. Gizzard helps in grinding the food particles. The entire foregut is lined by cuticle. A ring of 6-8 blind tubules called hepatic or gastric caeca is present at the junction of foregut and midgut, which secrete digestive juice. At the junction of midgut and hindgut is present another ring of 100-150 yellow coloured thin ﬁlamentous Malpighian tubules. They help in removal of excretory products from haemolymph. The hindgut is broader than midgut and is differentiated into ileum, colon and rectum. The rectum opens out through anus. Blood vascular system of cockroach is an open type (Figure 7.17). Blood vessels are poorly developed and open into space (haemocoel). Visceral organs located in the haemocoel are bathed in blood (haemolymph). The haemolymph is composed of colourless plasma and haemocytes. Heart of cockroach consists of elongated muscular tube lying along mid dorsal line of thorax and abdomen. It is differentiated into funnel shaped chambers with ostia on either side. Blood from sinuses enter heart through ostia and is pumped anteriorly to sinuses again.

Then, by the definition of the average velocity, the slope of line P1P2 ( Fig. 3.6) gives the value of average velocity over the interval 3 s to 5 s. Now, we decrease the value of Atfrom 2 s to 1 s. Then line P1P2 becomes @192 and its slope gives the value of the average velocity over the interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit At —> 0, the line P1P2 becomes tangent to the position- time curve at the point P and the velocity at t = 4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at that point. It is difficult to show this process graphically. But if we use numerical method to obtain the value of the velocity, the meaning of the limiting process becomes clear. For the graph shown in Fig. 3.6, X: 0.08 t3. Table 3.1 gives the value of Ax/At calculated for Atequal to 2.0 s, 1.0 s, 0.5 s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t= 4.0 s.

It is easier to calculate the value of velocity at different instants if we have data of positions at different instants or exact expression for the position as a function of time. Then, we calculate Ax/ At from the data for decreasing the value of At and find the limiting value as we have done in Table 3.1 or use differential calculus for the given expression and dx calculate d—t at different instants as done in the following example. att= 45 10.0 7. 84 7.29 3.86 6.14125 1.9225 5.31441 0.38402 5. 139224 0.0384",0

Whereas the tropical cyclones originate only over the seas and on reaching the land they dissipate. The extra tropical cyclone affects a much larger area as compared to the tropical cyclone. The wind velocity in a tropical cyclone is much higher and it is more destructive. The extra tropical cyclones move from west to east but tropical cyclones, move from east to west. Tropical Cyclones Tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges. This is one of the most devastating natural calamities. They are known as Cyclones in the Indian Ocean, Hurricanes in the Atlantic, Typhoons in the Western Pacific and South China Sea, and Willy-willies in the Western Australia. Tropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans. The conditions favourable for the formation and intensiﬁcation of tropical storms are: (i) Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C; (ii) Presence of the Coriolis force; (iii) Small variations in the vertical wind speed; (iv) A pre-existing weak- low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation; (v) Upper divergence above the sea level system. The energy that intensiﬁes the storm, comes from the condensation process in the towering cumulonimbus clouds, surrounding the centre of the storm. With continuous supply of moisture from the sea, the storm is further strengthened. On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off and the storm dissipates. The place where a tropical cyclone crosses the coast is called the landfall of the cyclone. The cyclones, which cross 20° N latitude generally, recurve and they are more destructive. 91 A schematic representation of the vertical structure of a mature tropical cyclonic storm is shown in Figure 10.10. A mature tropical cyclone is characterised by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre, called the eye. The diameter of the circulating system can vary between 1 50 and 250 km. The eye is a region of calm with subsiding air. Around the eye is the eye wall, where there is a strong spiralling ascent of air to greater height reaching the tropopause. The wind reaches maximum velocity in this region, reaching as high as 250 km per hour. Torrential rain occurs here. From the eye wall rain bands may radiate and trains of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds may drift into the outer region. The diameter of the storm over the Bay of Bengal, Arabian sea and Indian ocean is between 600 - 1200 km. The system moves slowly about 300 - 500 km per day. The cyclone creates storm surges and they inundate the coastal low lands. The storm peters out on the land.

443,1108,"EVOLUTION frequencies, for example, can be named p, q, etc. In a diploid, p and q represent the frequency of allele A and allele a. The frequency of AA individuals in a population is simply p2. This is simply stated in another ways, i.e., the probability that an allele Awith a frequency of p appear on both the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product of the probabilities, i.e., p2. Similarly of aa is q2, of Aa 2pq. Hence, p2+2pq+q2=1. This is a binomial expansion of (p+q)2. When frequency measured, differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates the extent of evolutionary change. Disturbance in genetic equilibrium, or Hardy— Weinberg equilibrium, i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a population would then be interpreted as resulting in evolution. Five factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These are gene migration or gene ﬂow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic recombination and natural selection. When migration of a section of population to another place and population occurs, gene frequencies change in the original as well as in the new population. New genes / alleles are added to the new population and these are lost from the old population. There would be a gene ﬂow if this gene migration, happens multiple times. If the same change occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift. Sometimes the change in allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population that they become a different species. The original drifted population becomes founders and the effect is called founder effect. Microbial experiments show that pre-existing advantageous mutations when selected will result in observation of new phenotypes. Over few generations, this would result in Speciation. Natural selection is a process in which heritable variations enabling better survival are enabled to reproduce and leave greater number of progeny. A critical analysis makes us believe that variation due to mutation or variation due to recombination during gametogenesis, or due to gene ﬂow or genetic drift results in changed frequency of genes and alleles in future generation. Coupled to enhance reproductive success, natural selection makes it look like different population. Natural selection can lead to stabilisation (in which more individuals acquire mean character value), directional change (more individuals acquire value other than the mean character value) or disruption (more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both ends of the distribution curve) (Figure 7.8). 7.8 A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF EVOLUTION About 2000 million years ago (mya) the ﬁrst cellular forms of life appeared on earth.

More than 99.9% mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus. On the atomic scale, mass is measured in atomic mass units (u). By definition, 1 atomic mass unit [lu] is 1/ 12th mass of one atom of 120; lu = 1.660563 x 10‘27 kg. A nucleus contains a neutral particle called neutron. Its mass is almost the same as that of proton The atomic number Z is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus of an element. The mass number A is the total number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus; A = Z+N; Here N denotes the number of neutrons in the nucleus. A nuclear species or a nuclide is represented as 2X, where X is the chemical symbol of the species. Nuclides with the same atomic number Z, but different neutron number N are called isotopes. Nuclides with the same A are isobars and those with the same N are isotones. Most elements are mixtures of two or more isotopes. The atomic mass of an element is a weighted average of the masses of its isotopes. The masses are the relative abundances of the isotopes. A nucleus can be considered to be spherical in shape and assigned a radius. Electron scattering experiments allow determination of the nuclear radius; it is found that radii of nuclei fit the formula R = R0 Al/S’ where R0 = a constant = 1.2 fm. This implies that the nuclear density is independent of A. It is of the order of 1017 kg/ms. Neutrons and protons are bound in a nucleus by the short—range strong nuclear force. The nuclear force does not distinguish between neutron and proton. The nuclear mass M is always less than the total mass, Em, of its constituents. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents is called the mass defect, AM=[Zmp+[A~Z]mn)—M Using Einstein’s mass energy relation, we express this mass difference in terms of energy as AEb = AM c2 The energy AEb represents the binding energy of the nucleus. In the mass number range A = 30 to 170, the binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant, about 8 MeV/ nucleon. Energies associated with nuclear processes are about a million times larger than chemical process. The Q—value of a nuclear process is Q = final kinetic energy ~ initial kinetic energy. Due to conservation of mass—energy, this is also, Q = [sum of initial masses — sum of final masses)c2 Radioactivity is the phenomenon in which nuclei of a given species transform by giving out on or ,B or yrays; a—rays are helium nuclei; 2019-20 Nuclei 459",0

Despite inherent limitations, many rivers have been modified to enhance their navigability by dredging, stabilising river banks, and building dams and barrages for regulating the ﬂow of water. The following river waterways are some of the world’s important highways of commerce. The Rhine Waterways The Rhine ﬂows through Germany and the Netherlands. It is navigable for 700 km from Rotterdam, at its mouth in the Netherlands to Basel in Switzerland. Ocean-going vessels can reach up to Cologne. The Ruhr river joins the Rhine from the east. It ﬂows through a rich coalfield and the whole basin has become a prosperous manufacturing area. Dusseldorf is the Rhine port for this region. Huge tonnage moves along the stretch south of the Ruhr. This waterway is the world’s most heavily used. Each year more than 20,000 ocean-going ships and 2,00,000 inland vessels exchange their cargoes. It connects the industrial areas of Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands with the North Atlantic Sea Route.

Certain 10. 11. 12. physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities [such as length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity]. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is Widely used throughout the world. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by means of SI units with special names [such as joule, newton, watt, etc). The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols [such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.). Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired units are obtained. Direct and indirect methods can be used for the measurement of physical quantities. In measured quantities, while expressing the result, the accuracy and precision of measuring instruments along with errors in measurements should be taken into account. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained. Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic operations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong. 2019-20",0

Antibiotics have greatly improved our capacity to treat deadly diseases such as plague, whooping cough (kali khansi), diphtheria (gal ghotu) and leprosy (kusht rog), which used to kill millions all over the globe. Today, we cannot imagine a world Without antibiotics. 10.2.3 Chemicals, Enzymes and other Bioactive Molecules Microbes are also used for commercial and industrial production of certain chemicals like organic acids, alcohols and enzymes. Examples of acid producers are Aspergillus niger (a fungus) of citric acid, Acetobacter aceti (a bacterium) of acetic acid; Clostridium butylicum (a bacterium) of butyric acid and Lactobacillus (a bacterium) of lactic acid. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is used for commercial production of ethanol. Microbes are also used for production of enzymes. Lipases are used in detergent formulations and are helpful in removing oily stains from the laundry. You must have noticed that bottled fruit juices bought from the market are clearer as compared to those made at home. This is because the bottled juices are clariﬁed by the use of pectinases and proteases. Streptokinase produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and modiﬁed by genetic engineering is used as a ‘clot buster’ for removing clots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone myocardial infarction leading to heart attack. Another bioactive molecule, cyclosporin A, that is used as an immunosuppressive agent in organ-transplant patients, is produced by the fungus Trichoderma polysporum. Statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus have been commercialised as blood-cholesterol lowering agents. It acts by competitively inhibiting the enzyme responsible for synthesis of cholesterol. 10.3 MICROBES IN SEWAGE TREATMENT We know that large quantities of waste water are generated everyday in cities and towns. A major component of this waste water is human excreta. This municipal waste-water is also called sewage. It contains large amounts of organic matter and microbes. Many of which are pathogenic. Have you ever wondered where this huge quantity of sewage or urban waste water is disposed off daily? This cannot be discharged into natural water bodies like rivers and streams directly — you can understand why.

453,1003,"276 BIOLOGY Occupational Respiratory Disorders: In certain industries, especially those involving grinding or stone-breaking, so much dust is produced that the defense mechanism of the body cannot fully cope with the situation. Long exposure can give rise to inﬂammation leading to ﬁbrosis (proliferation of ﬁbrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung damage. Workers in such industries should wear protective masks. SUMMARY Cells utilise oxygen for metabolism and produce energy along with substances like carbon dioxide which is harmful. Animals have evolved different mechanisms for the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide from there. We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and associated air passages to perform this function. The ﬁrst step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in (inspiration) and the alveolar air is relegeél‘nut (expiration) Exchange of O2 and CO2 between deoxygenated blood and alve'qh, transpoit of these gases throughout the2 body by blood, exchange 0&0?"" d 6202 betweenrth’e oxygenated blood and tissues and utilisation of O 2b3f the cell‘s (cellular respiratlon) are the other steps involved. ‘7 r. .. ‘ Inspiration and exprnatlmn between the atmosphere a‘itld the alvedll- intercostals and diaphragm Volumes‘ ref air involved in these activities can be estimated with therhejpl of spirometer and are of clinical signiﬁcance. Exchange of 62 arfd CO2 at the’alYeoll and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of diffusion 1s dependent on the‘pa’rrtlal pressure gradients of 02 (p02) and CO2 (pCO2 ), their solubility as well as thel‘vthickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in our body facilitate d1ffus1on of 02 from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as well as from the oxy enated blood2 to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the diffusion of CO2 in? e/eppOSIte direction, 1. e., from tissues to alveoli. Oxygen 1s transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where p02 is higher, 02 gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues where p02 is low and pCO2 and H’“ concentration are high. Nearly 7 0 per cent of carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCOQ with the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO2 is high, it gets bound to blood whereas in the alveoli where pCO2 is low and p02 is high, it gets removed from the blood. Respiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla region of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a chemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism.",1
454,284,"354 Let 0 be the angle made by the string with the vertical. When the bob is at the mean position, 9 = 0 There are only two forces acting on the bob; the tension T along the string and the vertical force due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be resolved into the component mg cost) along the string and mg sine perpendicular to it. Since the motion of the bob is along a circle of length L and centre at the support point, the bob has a radial acceleration (wZL) and also a tangental acceleration; the latter arises since motion along the arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial acceleration is provided by the net radial force T —mg cosG, while the tangential acceleration is provided by mg sine. It is more convenient to work with torque about the support since the radial force gives zero torque. Torque 1' about the support is entirely provided by the tangental component of force 1 = —L (mg sine) (14.22) This is the restoring torque that tends to reduce angular displacement — hence the negative sign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion, 1' = ICC (14.23) where I is the moment of inertia of the system about the support and 0L is the angular acceleration. Thus, I a: —mg sin 0 L (14.24) Or, mgL a = — sin6 (14.25) We can simplify Eq. (14.25) if we assume that the displacement 9 is small. We know that sin 9 can be expressed as, sing: 0—£+i+m (14.26) 3! 5! _ where 6 is in radians. Now if 0 is small, sin 9 can be approximated by 0 and Eq. (14.25) can then be written as, mgL ‘1 = —T‘9 (14.27) In Table 14.1, we have listed the angle 9 in degrees, its equivalent in radians, and the value 2019-20 PHYSICS Sl-IM - how small should the amplitude be? When you perform the experiment to determine the time period of a simple pendulum, your teacher tells you to keep the amplitude small. But have you ever asked how small is small? Should the amplitude to 5°, 2°, 1°. or 05°? Or could it be 10°. 20°, or 30°? To appreciate this. it would be better to measure the time period for different amplitudes, up to large amplitudes. Of course, for large oscillations, you will have to take care that the pendulum oscillates in a vertical plane. Let us denote the time period for small-amplitude oscillations as T(0) and write the time period for amplitude 00 as ’1190) = cT(0). where cis the multiplying factor. If you plot a graph of c versus 00. you will get values somewhat like this: 20° 45° 50° 700 90° 1.02 1.04 1.05 1.10 1.18 This means that the error in the time period is about 2% at an amplitude of 20°. 5% at an amplitude of 50°. and 10% at an amplitude of 70° and 18% at an amplitude of 90°. In the experiment. you will never be able to measure T(0) because this means there are no oscillations. Even theoretically, sin 0 is exactly equal to 0 only for 6 = 0. There will be some inaccuracy for all other values of 0 . The difference increases with increasing 9 . Therefore we have to decide how much error we can tolerate. No measurement is ever perfectly accurate. You must also consider questions like these: What is the accuracy of the stopwatch? What is your own accuracy in starting and stopping the stopwatch? You will realise that the accuracy in your measurements at this level is never better than 5% or 10%. Since the above table shows that the time period of the pendulum increases hardly by 5% at an amplitude of 50° over its low amplitude value. you could very well keep the amplitude to be 50° in your experiments.",0

These, however, have resistivities characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities of semiconductors are also affected by presence of small amount of impurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for electronic devices.

Wire bound resistors are made by winding the wires of an alloy, viz., manganin, constantan, nichrome or similar ones. The choice of these materials is dictated mostly by the fact that their resistivities are relatively insensitive to temperature. These resistances are typically in the range of a fraction of an ohm to a few hundred ohms. 2019-20",0
456,868,"264 BIOLOGY No significant digestive activity occurs in the large intestine. The functions of large intestine are: (i) absorption of some water, minerals and certain drugs; (ii) secretion of mucus which helps in adhering the waste (undigested) particles together and lubricating it for an easy passage. The undigested, unabsorbed substances called faeces enters into the caecum of the large intestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back ﬂow of the faecal matter. It is temporarily stored in the rectum till defaecation. The activities of the gastro-intestinal tract are under neural and hormonal control for proper coordination of different parts. The sight, smell and / or the presence of food in the oral cavity can stimulate the secretion of saliva. Gastric and intestinal secretions are also, similarly, stimulated by neural signals. The muscular activities of different parts of the alimentary canal can also be moderated by neural mechanisms, both local and through CNS. Hormonal control of the secretion of digestive juices is carried out by local hormones produced by the gastric and intestinal mucosa. CALORIFIC VALUE OF PROTEIN, CARBOHYDRATE ANDFAT (Boxed item - Not for evaluation) The energy requirements 'of,=aniInals, and the energy content of food, are expressed in terms of measure, of heat energy because heat is the ultimate form of all energies. This is often measured to-as calol'ie (cal) or joule (J), which is the amount of heat energy required to raise th‘e‘temperature of 1 g of water by 1 °C. Since this value istiny amount of energy, physiologists commonly use kilocalorie (kcal) or kilo joule (kJ). One kilo calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water-“by 1 °C. Nutritionists, traditionally refer to kcal as the Calorie \or Joule (always capitalised). The amount of heat liberated from complete combustion of 1‘ g food in a bomb calorimeter (a closed metal chamber ﬁlled with 02) is its gross calon'ﬁc or gross energy value. The actual amount of energy combustion of 1g of food is the physiologic value of food. Gross caloriﬁc values of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are 4.1 kcal/ g, 5.65 kcal/ g and 9.45 kcal / g, respectively, whereas their physiologic values are 4.0 kcal / g, 4.0 kcal / g and 9.0 kcal/g, respectively. 16.3 ABSORPTION 0F DIGESTED PRODUCTS Absorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood or lymph. It is carried out by passive, active or facilitated transport mechanisms. Small amounts of monosaccharides like glucose, amino acids and some electrolytes like chloride ions are generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The passage of these substances into the blood depends upon the concentration gradients. However, some substances like glucose and amino acids are absorbed with the help of carrier proteins. This mechanism is called the facilitated transport. Transport of water depends upon the osmotic gradient. Active transport occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires energy. Various nutrients like amino acids, monosaccharides like glucose, electrolytes like Na+ are absorbed into the blood by this mechanism. Fatty acids and glycerol being insoluble, cannot be absorbed into the",1

Active transport is carried out by specific membrane-proteins. Hence different proteins in the membrane play a major role in both active as well as passive transport. Pumps are proteins that use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane. These pumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high concentration (‘uphill’ transport). Transport rate reaches a maximum when all the protein transporters are being used or are saturated. Like enzymes the carrier protein is very specific in what it carries across the membrane. These proteins are sensitive to inhibitors that react with protein side chains. 1 1 . 1 .4 Comparison of Different Transport Processes Table l 1.1 gives a comparison of the different transport mechanisms. Proteins in the membrane are responsible for facilitated diffusion and active transport and hence show common characterstics of being highly selective; they are liable to saturate, respond to inhibitors and are under hormonal regulation. But diffusion whether facilitated or not — take place only along a gradient and do not use energy.

A watermelon has over 92 per cent water; most herbaceous plants have only about 10 to 15 per cent of its fresh weight as dry matter. Of course, distribution of water within a plant varies — woody parts have relatively very little water, while soft parts mostly contain 2019-2020",1

Each one is a potential pollen or microspore mother cell. The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC) through meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores, as they are formed, are arranged in a cluster of four cells—the microspore tetrad (Figure 2.3 a). As the anthers mature and dehydrate, the microspores dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 2.3 b). Inside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen grains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther (Figure 2.3 c).

462,420,"Wave Optics = Sim” =tani 10 36 cosiB B ( ' ) This is known as Brewster’s law. Example 10.9 Unpolarised light is incident on a plane glass surface. What should be the angle of incidence so that the reﬂected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other? Solution For i + r to be equal to n/Z, we should have tan £3 = u = 1.5. This gives iB = 57°. This is the Brewster’s angle for air to glass interface. For simplicity, we have discussed scattering of light by 90°, and reﬂection at the Brewster angle. In this special situation, one of the two perpendicular components of the electric field is zero. At other angles, both components are present but one is stronger than the other. There is no stable phase relationship between the two perpendicular components since these are derived from two perpendicular components of an unpolarised beam. When such light is viewed through a rotating analyser, one sees a maximum and a minimum of intensity but not complete darkness. This kind of light is called partially polarised. Let us try to understand the situation. When an unpolarised beam of light is incident at the Brewster’s angle on an interface of two media, only part of light with electric field vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence will be reﬂected. Now by using a good polariser, if we completely remove all the light with its electric vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence and let this light be incident on the surface of the prism at Brewster’s angle, you will then observe no reﬂection and there will be total transmission of light. We began this chapter by pointing out that there are some phenomena which can be explained only by the wave theory. In order to develop a proper understanding, we first described how some phenomena like reﬂection and refraction, which were studied on this basis of Ray Optics in Chapter 9, can also be understood on the basis of Wave Optics. Then we described Young’s double slit experiment which was a turning point in the study of optics. Finally, we described some associated points such as diffraction, resolution, polarisation, and validity of ray optics. In the next chapter, you will see how new experiments led to new theories at the turn of the century around 1900 AD. SUMMARY 1. Huygens’ principle tells us that each point on a wavefront is a source of secondary waves, which add up to give the wavefront at a later time. 2. Huygens’ construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward envelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is independent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays are then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel 2019-20 6‘01 EI’IJWVXQ 381",0

A central force is such that the force on the planet is along the vector joining the Sun and the planet. Let the Sun be at the origin and let the position and momentum of the planet be denoted by r and p respectively. Then the area swept out by the planet of mass m in time interval At is (Fig. 8.2) AA given by AA = 1/2 (r x vAt) (8.1) Hence AA/At =1/2 (r x p)/m, (since v = p/m) = L / (2 m) (8.2) where v is the velocity, L is the angular momentum equal to ( r x p). For a central force, which is directed along r, L is a constant Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) was a scientist of German origin. He formulated the three laws of planetary motion based on the painstaking : observations of Tycho Brahe and coworkers. Kepler himself was an assistant to Brahe and it took him sixteen long years to arrive at the three planetary laws. He is also known as the founder of geometrical optics. being the ﬁrst to describe what happens to light after it enters a telescope. Refer to information given in the Box on Page 182 as the planet goes around. Hence, AA /At is a constant according to the last equation. This is the law of areas. Gravitation is a central force and hence the law of areas follows. Example 8.1 Let the speed of the planet at the perihelion Pin Fig. 8.1(a) be up and the Sun—planet distance SP be rp. Relate {rp. up} to the corresponding quantities at the aphelion {rA DA}. Will the planet take equal times to traverse BAC and CPB ? Answer The magnitude of the angular momentum at Pis L1) = up, since inspection tells us that rp and v1) are mutually perpendicular. Similarly, LA = mp rA DA. From angular momentum conservation TTIPTPUP=H1PTAUA U_P_TA or _ 4 DA rp Since rA > rp, up > vA. The area SBAC bounded by the ellipse and the radius vectors SB and SC is larger than SBPC in Fig. 8. 1. From Kepler’s second law, equal areas are swept in equal times. Hence the planet will take a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB. 8.3 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION Legend has it that observing an apple falling from a tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an universal law of gravitation that led to an explanation of terrestrial gravitation as well as of Kepler’s laws. Newton’s reasoning was that the moon revolving in an orbit of radius Rm was subject to a centripetal acceleration due to earth’s gravity of magnitude V2 4722Rm am 2 — : 2 (8.3) Rm T where V is the speed of the moon related to the time period T by the relation V = 271'Rm / T. The time period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was already known then to be about 3.84 X 108m. If we substitute these numbers in Eq. (8.3), we get a value of am much smaller than the value of acceleration due to gravity g on the surface of the earth, arising also due to earth’s gravitational attraction. 2019-20",0

Some organisms breed only once in their lifetime (Paciﬁc salmon ﬁsh, bamboo) while others breed many times during their lifetime (most birds and mammals). Some produce a large number of small-sized offspring (Oysters, pelagic ﬁshes) while others produce a small number of large-sized offspring (birds, mammals). So, which is desirable for maximising ﬁtness? Ecologists suggest that life history traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints imposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which they live. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an important area of research being conducted by ecologists. 13.2.4 Population Interactions Can you think of any natural habitat on earth that is inhabited just by a single species? There is no such habitat and such a situation is even inconceivable. For any species, the minimal requirement is one more species on which it can feed. Even a plant species, which makes its own food, cannot suivive alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the organic matter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption. And then, how will the plant manage pollination without an animal agent? It is obvious that in nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot live in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological community. Even in minimal communities, many interactive linkages exist, although all may not be readily apparent. Interspeciﬁc interactions arise from the interaction of populations of two different species. They could be beneﬁcial, detrimental or neutral (neither harm nor beneﬁt) to one of the species or both. Assigning a ‘+’ sign for beneﬁcial interaction, ‘-’ sign for detrimental and O for neutral interaction, let us look at all the possible outcomes of interspecific interactions (Table 1 3. 1) .

Large steamers can go through this route up to Minneapolis. AIR TRANSPORT Air transport is the fastest means of transportation, but it is very costly. Being fast, it is preferred by passengers for long-distance travel. Valuable cargo can be moved rapidly on a world-wide scale. It is often the only means to reach inaccessible areas. Air transport has brought about a connectivity revolution in the world. The frictions created by mountainous snow fields or inhospitable desert terrains have been overcome. The accessibility has increased. The airplane brings varied articles to the Eskimos in Northern Canada unhindered by the frozen ground. In the Himalayan region, the routes are often obstructed due to landslides, avalanches or heavy snow fall. At such times, air travel is the only alternative to reach a place. Airways also have great strategic importance. The air strikes by US. and British forces in Iraq bears testimony to this fact. The airways network is expanding very fast. Fig. 8.15: An Aeroplane at Salsburg Airport The manufacturing of aircrafts and their operations require elaborate infrastructure like hangars, landing, fuelling, and maintenance facilities for the aircrafts. The construction of airports is also very expensive and has developed more in highly industrialised countries where there is a large volume of trafﬁc. At present no place in the world is more than 35 hours away. This startling fact has been made possible due to people who build and ﬂy airplanes. Travel by air can now be measured by hours and minutes instead of years and months. Frequent air services are available to many parts of the world. Although, U.K. pioneered the use of commercial jet transport, U.S.A. developed largely post-War international civil aviation. Today, more than 250 commercial airlines offer regular services to different parts of the world. Recent developments can change the future course of air transport. Supersonic aircraft, cover the distance between London and New York within three and a half hours. Inter-Continental Air Routes In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a distinct east-west belt of inter-continental air routes. Dense network exists in Eastern U.SA., Western Europe and Southeast Asia. U.S.A. alone accounts for 60 per cent of the airways of the world. New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt Rome, Moscow, Karachi, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangkok, Singapore, Tokyo, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago are the nodal points where air routes converge or radiate to all continents. Africa, Asiatic part of Russia and South America lack air services. There are limited air services between 10-35 latitudes in the Southern hemisphere due to sparser population, limited landmass and economic development. PIPELINES Pipelines are used extensively to transport liquids and gases such as water, petroleum and natural gas for an uninterrupted ﬂow. Water supplied through pipelines is familiar to all.

Subphyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are often referred to as protochordates (Figure 4.17) and are exclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochord is present only in larval tail, while in Cephalochordata, it extends from head to tail region and is persistent throughout their life. Examples: Urochordata — Ascidia, Salpa, Doliolum; Cephalochordata — Branchiostoma (Amphioxus or Lancelet). The members of subphylum Vertebrata possess notochord during the embryonic period. The notochord is replaced by a cartilaginous or bony vertebral column in the adult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates but all chordates are not vertebrates. Besides the basic chordate characters, vertebrates have a ventral muscular heart With two, three or four chambers, kidneys for excretion and osmoregulation and paired appendages which may be ﬁns or limbs.

The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with one point fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed point taken as the origin. The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position vector is R : Emil} M Velocity of the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/ M, where P is the linear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the system is concentrated at this point and all the extemal forces act at it.

Hence, it is termed as inducer. In the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is provided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is transported into the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a very low level of expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all the time, otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces the operon in the following manner. The repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time — constitutively) from the igene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In the presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is inactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase access to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 6.14). Essentially, regulation of lac operon can also be visualised as regulation of enzyme synthesis by its substrate. 1 1 7 Remember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac operon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed in the presence of lactose? Regulation of lac operon by repressor is referred to as negative regulation.

The sphygmomanometer is a device, which measures these extreme pressures. It works on the principle that blood ﬂow in the brachial (upper arm) artery can be made to go from laminar to turbulent by suitable compression. Turbulent ﬂow is dissipative, and its sound can be picked up on the stethoscope. The gauge pressure in an air sack wrapped around the upper arm is measured using a manometer or a dial pressure gauge (Fig. 10.27). The pressure in the sack is first increased till the brachial artery is closed. The pressure in the sack is then slowly reduced while a stethoscope placed just below the sack is used to listen to noises arising in the brachial artery. When the pressure is just below the systolic (peak) pressure, the artery opens brieﬂy. During this brief Air sack period, the blood velocity in the highly constricted Stethoscope\ artery is high and turbulent and hence noisy. The resulting noise is heard as a tapping sound on the stethoscope. When the pressure in the sack is lowered further, the artery remains open for a longer portion of the heart cycle. Nevertheless, it remains closed during the diastolic (minimum pressure) phase of the heartbeat. Thus the duration of the tapping sound is longer. When the pressure in the sack reaches the diastolic pressure the artery is open during the entire heart cycle. The ﬂow is however, still turbulent and noisy. But instead of a tapping sound we hear a steady, continuous roar on the stethoscope. Fig. 1 0.27 Blood pressure measurement using the sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. The blood pressure of a patient is presented as the ratio of systolic / diastolic pressures. For a resting healthy adult it is typically 120/80 mm of Hg (120/80 torr). Pressures above 140/90 require medical attention and advice. High blood pressures may seriously damage the heart, kidney and other organs and must be controlled. 2019-20",0

You may recall that we had discussed the superposition principle in Chapter 15 of your Class XI textbook. Indeed the entire field of interference is based on the superposition principle according to which at a particular point in the medium, the resultant displacement produced by a number of waves is the vector sum of the displacements produced by each of the waves. Consider two needles S1 and S2 moving periodically up and down in an identical fashion in a trough of water [Fig 1 O.8(a)]. They produce two water waves, and at a particular point, the phase difference between the displacements produced by each of the waves does not change with time; when this happens the two sources are said to be coherent. Figure 10.8(b) shows the position of crests (solid circles) and troughs (dashed circles) at a given instant of time. Consider a point P for which S1 P = S2 P Since the distances S1 P and S2 P are equal, waves from S1 and 82 will take the same time to travel to the point P and waves that emanate from S1 and S2 in phase will also arrive, at the point P, in phase.

Its velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 3.1 l. OIIIIIIIIII Tt—> Fig. 3.1 1 Area under v—t curve equals displacement of the object over a given time interval. The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between t = O and t= T is the area of the rectangle of height u and base T. Therefore, area = uXT = uT which is the displacement in this time interval. How come in this case an area is equal to a distance? Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at the answer. Note that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown in several ﬁgures in this chapter have sharp kinks at some points implying that the functions are not differentiable at these points. In any realistic situation, the functions will be differentiable at all points and the graphs will be smooth. What this means physically is that acceleration and velocity cannot change values abruptly at an instant. Changes are always continuous. 3.6 KINEMATIC EQUATIONS FOR UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive some simple equations that relate displacement (x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v0), final velocity (v) and acceleration (a).

480,1497,"124 A habitat in the ecological sense is the totality of the physical and chemical factors that constitute the general environment. A system consisting of biotic and abiotic components is known as ecosystem. All these components in ecosystem are inter related and interact with each other. Different types of ecosystems exist with varying ranges of environmental conditions where various plants and animal species have got adapted through evolution. This phenomenon is known as ecological adaptation. Types of Ecosystems Ecosystems are of two major types: terrestrial and aquatic. Terrestrial ecosystem can be further be classiﬁed into ‘biomes’. A biome is a plant and animal community that covers a large geographical area. The boundaries of different biomes on land are determined mainly by climate. Therefore, a biome can be defined as the total assemblage of plant and animal species interacting within specific conditions. These include rainfall, temperature, humidity and soil conditions. Some of the major biomes of the world are: forest, grassland, desert and tundra biomes. Aquatic ecosystems can be classed as marine and freshwater ecosystems. Marine ecosystem includes the oceans, estuaries and coral reefs. Freshwater FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY ecosystem includes lakes, ponds, streams, marshes and bogs. Structure and Functions of Ecosystems The structure of an ecosystem involves a description of the available plant and animal species. From a structural point of view, all ecosystems consist of abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors include rainfall, temperature, sunlight, atmospheric humidity, soil conditions, inorganic substances (carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, etc.). Biotic factors include the producers, the consumers (primary, secondary, tertiary) and the decomposers. The producers include all the green plants, which manufacture their own food through photosynthesis. The primary consumers include herbivorous animals like deer, goats, mice and all plant-eating animals. The carnivores include all the ﬂesh-eating animals like snakes, tigers and lions. Certain carnivores that feed also on carnivores are known as top carnivores like hawks and mongooses. Decomposers are those that feed on dead organisms (for example, scavengers like vultures and crows), and further breaking down of the dead matter by other decomposing agents like bacteria and various micro- organisms.

481,1283,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS directly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are dependent on dead and decaying matter. What is important to recognise is that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from photosynthesis. This chapter deals with cellular respiration or the mechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release energy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP. Photosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the eukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy takes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria (also only in eukaryotes). The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds through oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable amount of energy is called respiration. The compounds that are oxidised during this process are known as respiratory substrates. Usually carbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even organic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under certain conditions. During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained in respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single step. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by enzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP. Hence, it is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in respiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to synthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy needs to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell. This energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring processes of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during respiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in the cell. 14. 1 Do PLANTS BREATHE? Well, the answer to this question is not quite so direct. Yes, plants require 02 for respiration to occur and they also give out C02. Hence, plants have systems in place that ensure the availability of 02. Plants, unlike animals, have no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata and lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants can get along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of its own gas-exchange needs. There is very little transport of gases from one plant part to another. Second, plants do not present great demands for gas exchange. Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower than animals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gases exchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needs during these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O2 is not a problem in these cells since 02 is released within the cell. Third, the 227",1

483,1213,"248 BIOLOGY The ‘bakanae’ (foolish seedling) disease of rice seedlings, was caused by a fungal pathogen Gibberellafujikuroi. E. Kurosawa (1926) reported the appearance of symptoms of the disease in rice seedlings when they were treated with sterile ﬁltrates of the fungus. The active substances were later identiﬁed as gibberellic acid. F. Skoog and his co-workers observed that from the internodal segments of tobacco stems the callus (a mass of undifferentiated cells) proliferated only if, in addition to auxins the nutrients medium was supplemented with one of the following: extracts of vascular tissues, yeast extract, coconut milk or DNA. Miller et al. (1955), later identiﬁed and crystallised the cytokinesis promoting active substance that they termed kinetin. During mid- 1960s, three independent researches reported the puriﬁcation and chemical characterisation of three different kinds of inhibitors: inhibitor-B, abscission II and dormin. Later all the three were proved to be chemically identical. It was named abscisic acid (ABA). H.H. Cousins (19 10) conﬁrmed the release of a volatile substance from ripened oranges that hastened the ripening of stored unripened bananas. Later this volatile substance was identiﬁed as ethylene, a gaseous PGR. Let us study some of the physiological effects of these ﬁve categories of PGRs in the next section. 15.4.3 Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators 15.4.3.1 Auxins Auxins (from Greek ‘auxein’ : to grow) was ﬁrst isolated from human urine. The term ‘auxin’ is applied to the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and to other natural and synthetic compounds having certain growth regulating properties. They are generally produced by the growing apices of the stems and roots, from where they migrate to the regions of their action. Auxins like IAA and indole butyric acid (IBA) have been isolated from plants. NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) are synthetic auxins. All these auxins have been used extensively in agricultural and horticultural practices. They help to initiate rooting in stem cuttings, an application widely used for plant propagation. Auxins promote ﬂowering e. g. in pineapples. They help to prevent fruit and leaf drop at early stages but promote the abscission of older mature leaves and fruits. In most higher plants, the growing apical bud inhibits the growth of the lateral (axillary) buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance. Removal of shoot tips (decapitation) usually results in the growth of lateral buds (Figure 15. 1 1). It is widely applied in tea plantations, hedge-making. Can you explain why?",1

Animals and plants exhibit a wide range of movements. Streaming of protoplasm in the unicellular organisms like Amoeba is a simple form of movement. Movement of cilia, ﬂagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms. Human beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the movements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary movements are called locomotion. Walking, running, climbing, ﬂying, swimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory structures need not be different from those affecting other types of movements. For example, in Paramoecium, cilia helps in the movement of food through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra can use its tentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use limbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above observations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied separately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are movements but all movements are not locomotions. Methods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats and the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for search of food, shelter, mate, suitable breeding grounds, favourable climatic conditions or to escape from enemies / predators. 20. l TYPES OF MOVEMENT Cells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely, amoeboid, ciliary and muscular. 2019-2020",1

488,66,"Electric Charges and Fields 1. 15 APPLICATIONS OF GAUss’s LAW The electric ﬁeld due to a general charge distribution is, as seen above, given by Eq. (1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the summation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried out to give electric ﬁeld at every point in space. For some symmetric charge configurations, however, it is possible to obtain the electric ﬁeld in a simple way using the Gauss’s law. This is best understood by some examples. 1.15.1 Field due to an inﬁnitely long straight uniformly charged wire Consider an inﬁnitely long thin straight wire with uniform linear charge density 2.. The wire is obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we take the radial vector from O to P and rotate it around the wire. The points P, P’, P” so obtained are completely equivalent with respect to the charged wire. This implies that the electric ﬁeld must have the same magnitude at these points. The direction of electric ﬁeld at every point must be radial (outward if A > O, inward if A < O). This is clear from Fig. 1.29. Consider a pair of line elements P1 and P2 of the wire, as shown. The electric ﬁelds produced by the two elements of the pair when summed give a resultant electric field which is radial (the components normal to the radial vector cancel). This is true for any such pair and hence the total ﬁeld at any point P is radial. Finally, since the wire is infinite, electric ﬁeld does not depend on the position of P along the length of the wire. In short, the electric ﬁeld is everywhere radial in the plane cutting the wire normally, and its magnitude depends only on the radial distance r. To calculate the ﬁeld, imagine a cylindrical Gaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. l .29(b). Since the field is everywhere radial, ﬂux through the two ends of the cylindrical Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical part of the surface, E is normal to the surface at every point, and its magnitude is constant, since it depends only on r. The surface area of the curved part is 2n rL where lis the length of the cylinder. (b) FIGURE 1.29 (a) Electric field due to an infinitely long thin straight wire is radial.

Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases such as cancer, cystic ﬁbrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s. (iii) Biological products: Medicines required to treat certain human diseases can contain biological products, but such products are often expensive to make. Transgenic animals that produce useful biological products can be created by the introduction of the portion of DNA (or genes) which codes for a particular product such as human protein (0c- 1 -antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. Similar attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic ﬁbrosis. In 1997, the ﬁrst transgenic cow, Rosie, produced human protein-enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre). The milk contained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was nutritionally a more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk. (iv) Vaccine safety: Transgenic mice are being developed for use in testing the safety of vaccines before they are used on humans. Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine. If successful and found to be reliable, they could replace the use of monkeys to test the safety of batches of the vaccine. (v) Chemical safety testing: This is known as toxicity/ safety testing. The procedure is the same as that used for testing tom'city of drugs. Transgenic animals are made that carry genes which make them more sensitive to tom'c substances than non-transgenic animals. They are then exposed to the toxic substances and the effects studied. Toxicity testing in such animals will allow us to obtain results in less time. 12.4 ETHICAL ISSUES The manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on any further, without regulation. Some ethical standards are required to evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living organisms. Going beyond the morality of such issues, the biological signiﬁcance of such things is also important. Genetic modiﬁcation of organisms can have unpredicatable results when such organisms are introduced into the ecosystem. Therefore, the Indian Government has set up organisations such as GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make decisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of introducing GM-organisms for public services.

This is a pot like surface [Fig 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but has its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular loop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box (Without the lid) [Fig 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere s circuital law to such surfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of Eq. (8. 1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not ,uoi, since no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we have a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a point P; calculated another way, the magnetic ﬁeld at P is zero. Since the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law, this law must be missing something. The missing term must be such that one gets the same magnetic field at point P, no matter What surface is used. We can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at Fig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the plates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric ﬁeld! If the plates of the capacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the electric field E between the plates is (Q/A) /20 (see Eq. 2.4 1). The field is perpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude over the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what is the electric ﬂux <DE through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is _i9 _2 E=|E|A 80 AA 80 (8.3) Now if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a current i= (dQ/dt), so that using Eq. (8.3), we have (1qu _i Q _id_Q dt dt 80 dt This implies that for consistency, d<1>E 8 = ' 8.4 o ( Cl t j l ( ) This is the missing term in Ampere’s circuital law. If we generalise this law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through the surface, another term which is so times the rate of change of electric ﬂux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current i for all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B obtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere’s law. B at the point P is non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a point P outside the plates [Fig 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just inside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to ﬂow of charges is called conduction current. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a new term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement, an old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacement current or Maxwell’s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric and magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above. The generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following.

Insertion or deletion of three or its multiple bases insert or delete in one or multiple codon hence one or multiple amino acids, and reading frame remains unaltered from that point onwards. 6.6.2 tRNA— the Adapter Molecule From the very beginning of the proposition of code, it was clear to Francis Crick that there has to be a mechanism to read the code and also to link it to the amino acids, because amino acids have no structural specialities to read the code uniquely. He postulated the presence of an adapter molecule that would on one hand read the code and on other hand would bind to speciﬁc amino acids. The tRNA, then called sRNA (soluble RNA), was known before the genetic code was postulated. However, its role as an adapter molecule was assigned much later. tRNA has an anticodon loop that has bases complementary to the code, and it also has an amino acid acceptor end to which it binds to amino acids. tRNAs are speciﬁc for each amino acid (Figure 6.12). For Figure 6.12 tRNA - the adapter molecule initiation there is another speciﬁc tRNA that is referred to as initiator tRNA. There are no tRNAs for stop codons. In ﬁgure 6.12, the secondary structure of tRNA has been depicted that looks like a clover-leaf. In actual structure, the tRNA is a compact molecule which looks like inverted L. 6.7 TRANSLATION Translation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to form a polypeptide (Figure 6.13). The order and sequence of amino acids are deﬁned by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. The amino acids are joined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond. Formation of a peptide bond requires energy. Therefore, in the ﬁrst phase itself amino acids are activated in the presence of ATP and linked to their cognate tRNA—a process commonly called as charging of tRNA or aminoacylation of tRNA to be more speciﬁc.

495,1447,"GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE through oceans. The geographical factors have modiﬁed the course of history in different parts of the world. Every geographical phenomenon undergoes change through time and can be explained temporally. The changes in landforms, climate, vegetation, economic activities occupations and cultural developments have followed a definite historical course. Many geographical features result from the decision making process by different institutions at a particular point of time. It is possible to convert time in terms of space and space in terms of time. For example, it can be said that place A is 1,500 km from place B or alternately, it can also be said that place A is two hours away (if one travels by plane) or seventeen hours away (if one travels by a fast moving train). It is for this reason, time is an integral part of geographical studies as the fourth dimension. Please mention other three dimensions? Figure1.1 amply depicts the linkages of geography with different natural and social sciences. This linkage can be put under two segments. Physical Geography and Natural Sciences All the branches of physical geography, as shown in Figure 1.1, have interface with natural sciences. The traditional physical geography is linked with geology, meteorology, hydrology and pedology, and thus, geomorphology, climatology, oceanography and soil geography respectively have very close link with the natural sciences as these derive their data from these sciences. Bio- Geography is closely related to botany, zoology as well as ecology as human beings are located in different locational niche. A geographer should have some proﬁciency in mathematics and art, particularly in drawing maps. Geography is very much linked with the study of astronomical locations and deals with latitudes and longitudes. The shape of the earth is Geoid but the basic tool of a geographer is a map which is two dimensional representation of the earth. The problem of converting geoids into two dimensions can be tackled by projections constructed graphically or mathematically. The cartographic and quantitative techniques require sufficient proficiency in mathematics, statistics and 5 econometrics. Maps are prepared through artistic imagination. Making sketches, mental maps and cartographic work require proficiency in arts. Geography and Social Sciences Each social science sketched in Figure 1.1 has interface with one branch of geography. The relationships between geography and history have already been outlined in detail. Every discipline has a philosophy which is the raison d’etre for that discipline. Philosophy provides roots to a discipline and in the process of its evolution, it also experiences distinct historical processes. Thus, the history of geographical thought as mother branch of geography is included universally in its curricula. All the social science disciplines, viz. sociology, political science, economics and demography study different aspects of social reality. The branches of geography, viz. social, political, economic and population and settlements are closely linked with these disciplines as each one of them has spatial attributes. The core concern of political science is territory, people and sovereignty while political geography is also interested in the study of the state as a spatial unit as well as people and their political behaviour. Economics deals with basic attributes of the economy such as production, distribution, exchange and consumption. Each of these attributes also has spatial aspects and here comes the role of economic geography to study the spatial aspects of production, distribution, exchange and consumption. Likewise, population geography is closely linked with the discipline of demography. The above discussion shows that geography has strong interface with natural and social sciences. It follows its own methodology of study which makes it distinct from others. It has osmotic relationship with other disciplines. While all the disciplines have their own individual scope, this individuality does not obstruct the ﬂow of information as in case of all cells in the body that have individual identity separated by membranes but the ﬂow of blood is not obstructed.

(4.3), that is, F=q(E+va) =FE+FB We shall consider the simple case in which electric and magnetic ﬁelds are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, as shown in Fig. 4.7. We have, E=Ej,B=Bk,v=vi FE=qE=qu,FB=quB,=q(viXBk)=—qBj Therefore, F = q(E — vB) J . Thus, electric and magnetic forces are in opposite directions as shown in the figure. Suppose, we adjust the value of E and B such that magnitudes of the two forces are equal. Then, total force on FIGURE 4.7 the charge is zero and the charge will move in the fields undeﬂected. This happens when, x E qE = qu or v = E (4.7) This condition can be used to select charged particles of a particular velocity out Of a beam containing charges moving with different speeds (irrespective of their charge and mass). The crossed E and B ﬁelds, therefore, serve as a velocity selector. Only particles with speed E/ B pass undeﬂected through the region of crossed fields. This method was employed by J. J. Thomson in 1897 to measure the charge to mass ratio (e/ m) of an electron. The principle is also employed in Mass Spectrometer — a device that separates charged particles, usually ions, according to their charge to mass ratio. 33.0 4.4.2 Cyclotron The cyclotron is a machine to accelerate charged particles or ions to high energies. It was invented by ED. Lawrence and MS. Livingston in 1 934 to investigate nuclear structure. The cyclotron uses both electric and magnetic fields in combination to increase the energy of charged particles. As the fields are perpendicular to each other they are called crossed ﬁelds. Cyclotron uses the fact that the frequency of revolution of the charged particle in a magnetic field is independent of its energy. The particles move most of the time inside two semicircular disc-like metal containers, D1 and D2, which are called dees as they look like the letter D. Figure 4.8 shows a schematic view of the cyclotron. Inside the metal boxes the particle is shielded and is not acted on by the electric field. The 7 magnetic field, however, acts on the particle and makes it go round in a ""“’ circular path inside a dee. Every time the particle moves from one dee to another it is acted upon by the electric field. The sign of the electric field is changed alternately in tune with the circular motion of the particle. This ensures that the particle is always accelerated by the electric field. Each time the acceleration increases the energy of the particle.

497,786,"BIOLOGY predator or the effect of a pesticide application, we always evaluate them in terms of any change in the population size. The size, in nature, could be as low as < 10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or go into millions (Chlamydomonas in a pond). Population size, technically called population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be measured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most appropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either meaningless or difficult to determine. In an area, if there are 200 carrot grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants but only a single huge banyan tree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is low relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the enormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population size. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming. If you have a dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish what is the best measure to report its density? Sometimes, for certain ecological investigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities; relative densities serve the purpose equally well. For instance, the number of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population density in the lake. We are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes indirectly, without actually counting them or seeing them. The tiger census in our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and fecal pellets. 13.2.2 Population Growth The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter. It keeps changing with time, depending on various factors including food availability, predation pressure and adverse weather. In fact, it is these changes in population density that give us some idea of what is happening to the population — whether it is ﬂourishing or declining. Whatever might be the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat during a given period, ﬂuctuates due to changes in four basic processes, two of which (natality and immigration) contribute to an increase in population density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease. (i) Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density. (ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period. (iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period under consideration. (iv) Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under consideration. 2019-2020",1

The scrotum helps in maintaining the low temperature of the testes (2—2.5° C lower than the normal internal body temperature) necessary for spermatogenesis. In adults, each testis is oval in shape, with a length of about 4 to 5 cm and a width of about 2 to 3 cm. The testis is covered by a dense covering. Each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules (Figure 3.1b). Each lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules in which sperms are produced. Each seminiferous tubule is lined on its inside by two types of cells called male germ cells (spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells (Figure 3.2 ). The male germ cells undergo meiotic divisions ﬁnally leading to sperm formation, while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the germ cells. The regions outside the seminiferous tubules called interstitial spaces, contain small blood vessels and interstitial cells or Leydig cells (Figure 3.2). Leydig cells synthesise and secrete testicular hormones called androgens. Other immunologically competent cells are also present.

501,1104,"118 BIOLOGY On land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs. The respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are a pair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper part of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into the buccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernation gaseous exchange takes place through skin. The vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs have a lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood vessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph channels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the upper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one ventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangular structure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives blood through the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac- like conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from the heart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system). The veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form the venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestine as well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. The former is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal system. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells are RBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes and platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment namely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks few proteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to the respective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achieved by the pumping action of the muscular heart. The elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a well developed excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. These are compact, dark red and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity on both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of several structural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons. Two ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act as urinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters and oviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder is present ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frog excretes urea and thus is a ureotelic animal. Excretory wastes are carried by blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted. The system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. It includes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical coordination of various organs of the body is achieved by hormones which are secreted by the endocrine glands. The prominent endocrine glands found in frog are pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pineal body, pancreatic islets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous system is organised",1

More precisely, the total current iis the sum of the conduction current denoted by is, and the displacement current denoted by iCl (= 80 (chE/ i(t) dt)). So we have ddSE dt In explicit terms, this means that outside the capacitor plates, we have only conduction current iC = i, and no displacement (a) current, i.e., i d = 0. On the other hand, inside the capacitor, there is no conduction current, i.e., iC = O, and there is only displacement current, so that i d: i. The generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the same form as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: “the total current passing through any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter” is the sum of the conduction current and the displacement current. The generalised law is i=ic+id =ic+£0 (85) (8.6) and is known as Ampere-Maxwell law. In all respects, the displacement current has the same physical effects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steady electric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may be zero since the electric ﬁeld E does not change with time. In other FIGURE 8-2 (a) The cases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction f‘lecmc and magne‘lc and displacement currents may be present in different regions of ﬁelds E and B between space. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same the capacitor plates. at the point M. (b) A cross sectional View of Fig. (21). region of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions of space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a displacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a region, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction) current source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current can be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point M) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and is seen to be the same as that just outside (at P). The displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences. One thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and magnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday’s law of induction states that there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic ﬂux. Now, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit charge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence of an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction by saying that a magnetic ﬁeld, changing with time, gives rise to an electric ﬁeld. Then, the fact that an electric ﬁeld changing with time gives rise to a magnetic ﬁeld, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is * They are still not perfectly symmetrical; there are no known sources of magnetic field (magnetic monopoles) analogous to electric charges which are sources of electric field. 272 2019-20",0

505,855,"224 BIOLOGY SUMMARY Green plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During this process carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for making carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch. Photosynthesis takes place only in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the mesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO2 ﬁxation. Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction, while the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma. Photosynthesis has two stages: the light reaction and the carbon ﬁxing reactions. In the light reaction the light energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to special chlorophyll a molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two photosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll a P700 molecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction cemtge that absorbs red light at 680 nm. After absorbing light, eyctrons are exciteyl and transferred through PS II and PS I and ﬁnally to NADéféi‘ming NADH. <{Dumvfgg’thls process a proton gradient 1s created across the mg”? anle the thy yl\ dr‘The breakdown of the protons gradient due to movemynt : ough thegF 04pm; oﬁthe A’IPase enzyme releases enough energy for synth‘gs of ‘ETP Sp aﬁigg %f water molecules is associated with PS II resulting mﬁleﬁ r gage of 02, pgétﬁns and transfer of electrons to PS II. 3Q g?

In these plants the ﬁrst product of CO2 ﬁxation that takes place in the mesophyll, is a 4-carbon compound. In the bundle sheath cells the Calvin pathway is carried out for the synthesis of carbohydrates. EXERCISES 1. By looking at a plant externally can you tell whether a plant is C3 or C 4?

507,898,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS These graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes place in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis does take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum. Let us see how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments, also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation. 13.5 WHAT Is LIGHT REACTION? Light reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen release, and the formation of high-energy chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH. Several protein complexes are involved in the process. The pigments are organised into two discrete photochemical light harvesting complexes (LHC) within the Photosystem I (PS I) and Photosystem II (PS II). These are named in the sequence of their discovery, and not in the sequence in which they function during the light reaction. The LHC are made up of Photon hundreds of pigment molecules bound to . , proteins. Each photosystem has all the pigments . . . (except one molecule of chlorophyll a) forming . a light harvesting system also called antennae (Figure 13.4). These pigments help to make photosynthesis more efﬁcient by absorbing different wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll a molecule forms the reaction centre. The reaction centre is different in both the photosystems. In PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll a has an absorption peak at 700 nm, hence is called P700, while in PS II it has absorption maxima at 680 nm, and is called P680. 13.6 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT In photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll a absorbs 680 nm wavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump into an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus. These electrons are picked up by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transport Reaction centre Figure 13.4 The light harvesting complex",1

Biology is presented either as botany, zoology and microbiology or as classical and modern. The latter is a euphemism for molecular aspects of biology. Luckily we have many threads which weave the different areas of biological information into a unifying principle. Ecology is one such thread which gives us a holistic perspective to biology. The essence of biological understanding is to know how organisms, while remaining an individual, interact with other organisms and physical habitats as a group and hence behave like organised wholes, i.e., population, community, ecosystem or even as the whole biosphere. Ecology explains to us all this. A particular aspect of this is the study of anthropogenic environmental degradation and the socio-political issues it has raised. This unit describes as well as takes a critical view of the above aspects. 2019-2020",1
509,788,"216 BIOLOGY Scientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the ﬁrst product of CO2 ﬁxation, or whether any other product was formed in other plants. Experiments conducted over a wide range of plants led to the discovery of another group of plants, where the ﬁrst stable product of CO2 ﬁxation was again an organic acid, but one which had 4 carbon atoms in it. This acid was identiﬁed to be oxaloacetic acid or 0AA. Since then CO2 assimilation during photosynthesis was said to be of two main types: those plants in which the ﬁrst product of CO2 ﬁxation is a C3 acid (PGA), i.e., the C3 pathway, and those in which the ﬁrst product was a C 4 acid (0AA), i.e., the C 4 pathway. These two groups of plants showed other associated characteristics that we will discuss later. 13.7. 1 The Primary Acceptor of CO2 Let us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who were struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’. How many carbon atoms would a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) C02, would have 3 carbons (of PGA)? The studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule was a 5-carbon ketose sugar — ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Did any of you think of this possibility? Do not worry; the scientists also took a long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion. They also believed that since the ﬁrst product was a C3 acid, the primary acceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying to identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon RuBP. 13.7.2 The Calvin Cycle Calvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed that the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated. Let us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is synthesised. Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin pathway occurs in all photosynthetic plants; it does not matter whether they have C3 or C 4 (or any other) pathways Wigure 13.8). For ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under three stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration. l . Carboxylation — Carboxylation is the ﬁxation of CO2 into a stable organic intermediate. Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle where CO2 is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation of two molecules of 3-PGA. Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation activity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase or RuBisCO.",1

These are called hydro-electric generators. Alternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or other sources. The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of the armature. These are called thermal generators. Instead of coal, if a nuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators. Modern day generators produce electric power as high as 500 MW, i.e., one can light up 5 million 100 W bulbs! In most generators, the coils are held stationary and it is the electromagnets which are rotated. The frequency of rotation is 50 Hz in India. In certain countries such as USA, it is 60 Hz. Example 6.11 Kamla peddles a stationary bicycle. The pedals of the bicycle are attached to a 100 turn coil of area 0.10 m2. The coil rotates at half a revolution per second and it is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.01 T perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the coil. What is the maximum voltage generated in the coil? Solution Here v = 0.5 Hz; N =lOO, A = 0.1 m2 and B = 0.01 T. Employing Eq.

The four arms AB, BC, DA and CD [with resistances R, S, RCm land Rcm(100-l)] obviously form a Wheatstone bridge with AC as the battery arm and BD the galvanometer arm. If the jockey is moved along the wire, then there will be one position where the galvanometer will show no current. Let the distance of the jockey from the end A at the balance point be l= 11- The four resistances of the bridge at the balance point then are R, S, RCm l1 and Rcm(lOO—ll). The balance condition, Eq.

Then, the argument of the sine function in Equation (1 5.2) is constant -03t. The displacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies sinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents of the medium at different positions execute simple harmonic motion. Finally, as tincreases, xmust increase in the positive direction to keep kx— cot + q) constant. Thus, Eq. (15.2) represents a sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along the positive direction of the x—axis. On the other hand, a function y(x,t)=asin(kx+u)t+¢) (15.4) represents a wave travelling in the negative direction of x-axis.

(15.2) Fig. 15.6 shows the plots of Eq. (15.2) for different values of time differing by equal intervals of time. In a wave, the crest is the point of maximum positive displacement, the trough is the point of maximum negative displacement. To see how a wave travels, we can fix attention on a crest and see how it progresses with time. In the figure, this is shown by a cross (X) on the crest. In the same manner, we can see the motion of a particular constituent of the medium at a fixed location, say at the origin of the x—axis. This is shown by a solid dot (0). The plots of Fig. 15.6 show that with time, the solid dot (0) at the origin moves periodically, i.e., the particle at the origin oscillates about its mean position as the wave progresses. This is true for any other location also. We also see that during the time the solid dot (0) has completed one full oscillation, the crest has moved further by a certain distance. (6) Fig. 15.6 A harmonic wave progressing along the positive direction of x—axis at different times. Using the plots of Fig. 15.6, we now define the various quantities of Eq.

We can take a to be a positive constant, without any loss of generality. Then, a represents the maximum displacement of the constituents of the medium from their equilibrium position. Note that the displacement y may be positive or negative, but a is positive. It is called the amplitude of the wave. The quantity (kx — wt + (p) appearing as the argument of the sine function in Eq. (15.2) is called the phase of the wave. Given the amplitude a, the phase determines the displacement of the wave at any position and at any instant. Clearly q) is the phase at x = O and t = 0. Hence, ¢ is called the initial phase angle. By suitable choice of origin on the x—axis and the intial time, it is possible to have (1) = 0.

That we all grow old (if we live long enough), is something that we recognise. But what is meant by growing old? The end of reproductive phase can be considered as one of the parameters of senescence or old age. There are concomitant changes in the body (like slowing of metabolism, etc.) during this last phase of life span. Old age ultimately leads to death. In both plants and animals, hormones are responsible for the transitions between the three phases. Interaction between hormones and certain environmental factors regulate the reproductive processes and the associated behavioural expressions of organisms. Events in sexual reproduction 2 After attainment of maturity, all sexually reproducing organisms exhibit events and processes that have remarkable fundamental similarity, even though the structures associated with sexual reproduction are indeed very different. The events of sexual reproduction though elaborate and complex, follow a regular sequence. Sexual reproduction is characterised by the fusion (or fertilisation) of the male and female gametes, the formation of zygote and embryogenesis. For convenience these sequential events may be grouped into three distinct stages namely, the pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and the post-fertilisation events. 1 .2. 1 Pro-fertilisation Events These include all the events of sexual reproduction prior to the fusion of gametes. The two main pre-fertilisation events are gametogenesis and gamete transfer. 1.2.1.1 Gametogenesis As you are already aware, gametogenesis refers to the process of formation of the two types of gametes — male and female. Gametes are haploid cells.

We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question. Let us first guess the answer based on our common experience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a ﬂowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces) can exert force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab) ? Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion? 2019-20",0

527,1099,"114 BIOLOGY opening of the spiracles is regulated by the sphincters. Exchange of gases take place at the tracheoles by diffusion. Excretion is performed by Malpighian tubules. Each tubule is lined by glandular and ciliated cells. They absorb nitrogenous waste products and convert them into uric acid which is excreted out through the hindgut. Therefore, this insect is called uricotelic. In addition, the fat body, nephrocytes and urecose glands also help in excretion. The nervous system of cockroach consists of a series of fused, segmentally arranged ganglia joined by paired longitudinal connectives on the ventral side. ’Ihree ganglia lie in the thorax, and six in the abdomen. The nervous system of cockroach is spread throughout the body. The head holds a bit of a nervous system while the rest is situated along the ventral (belly-side) part of its body. So, now you understand that if the head of a cockroach is cut off, it will still live for as long as one week. In the head region, the brain is represented by supra-oesophageal ganglion which supplies nerves to antennae and compound eyes. In cockroach, the sense organs are antennae, eyes, maxillary palps, labial palps, anal cerci, etc. The compound eyes are situated at the dorsal surface of the head. Each eye consists of about 2000 hexagonal ommatidia (sing: ommatidium). With the help of several ommatidia, a cockroach can receive several images of an object. This kind of vision is known as mosaic vision with more sensitivity but less resolution, being common during night (hence called nocturnal vision). Cockroaches are dioecious and both sexes have well developed reproductive organs (Figure 7.18). Male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes one lying on each lateral side in the 4th -6th abdominal segments. From each testis arises a thin vas deferens, which opens into ejaculatory duct through seminal vesicle. The ejaculatory duct opens into male gonopore situated ventral to anus. A characteristic mushroom- shaped gland is present in the 6‘11-7‘h abdominal segments which functions as an accessory reproductive gland. The external genitalia are represented by male gonapophysis or phallomere (chitinous asymmetrical structures, surrounding the male gonopore). The sperms are stored in the seminal vesicles and are glued together in the form of bundles called spermatophores which are discharged during copulation. The female reproductive sysytem consists of two large ovaries, lying laterally in the 2nd— 6“ abdominal segments. Each ovary is formed of a group of eight ovarian tubules or ovarioles, containing a chain of developing ova. Oviducts of each ovary unite into a single median oviduct (also called vagina) which opens into the genital chamber. A pair of spermatheca is present in the 6th segment which opens into the genital chamber. Sperms are transferred through spermatophores. Their fertilised eggs are encased in capsules called oothecae. Ootheca is a dark reddish to blackish brown capsule, about 3/ 8"" (8 mm) long. They are dropped or",1

Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is which is more than the height of Mt. Everest! SUMMARY 1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension. In general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress (associated with stretching) or compressive stress [associated with compression}, (b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress. 2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials. This is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of elasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus are used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces that act on them. A class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law. 3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form F/A = YAL/ L where AL/ L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, Fis the magnitude of the applied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied [perpendicular to A) and Yis the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A. 4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so that the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement AL of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is called shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is possible only in solids. In this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form F/A = G x AL/ L where AL is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F, and G is the shear modulus. 5. When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding ﬂuid, the Hooke’s law takes the form P = B (AV/ VI, where p is the pressure [hydraulic stress) on the object due to the ﬂuid, AV/ V (the volume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that pressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object. POINTS TO PONDER I. In the case ofa wire. suspended from celing and stretched under the action ofa weight (Fl suspended from its other end. the force exerted by the ceiling on it is equal and opposite to the weight. However. the tension at any crossesection A of the wire is just Fand not 2F. Hence. tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A. 2. Hooke‘s law is valid only in the linear part of stressrstrain curve. 3. The Young's modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids have lengths and shapes. 4. Bulk modulus is relevant for solids. liquid and gases. It refers to the change in volume when every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body remains unchanged. 2019-20",0
529,926,"74 BIOLOGY genotype t. As a result of random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can be of the genotypes TT, Tt or tt. From the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4th of the random fertilisations lead to TT, 1 / 2 lead to Tt and 1 /4th to tt. Though the F1 have a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall’. At F2, 3 / 4th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are Tt. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with the genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one character ‘T’ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall’ is said to dominate over the other allele t or ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this dominance of one character over the other that all the F1 are tall (though the genotype is Tt) and in the F2 3/4th of the plants are tall (though genotypically 1 / 2 are Tt and only 1 /4th are TT). This leads to a phenotypic ratio of 3/4‘htall : (1/4TT + 1/2 Tt) and 1/4th tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio, but a genotypic ratio of 1 :2: 1. The 1 / 4 : 1 / 2 : 1 / 4 ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable to the form of the binomial expression (ax +by)2, that has the gametes bearing genes T or t in equal frequency of 1/2. The expression is expanded as given below : (1/2T+ 1/2t)2 =(1/2T+ 1/2t)X(1/2T+ 1/2t) = 1/4TT+ 1/2Tt+ 1/4-tt Mendel self-pollinated the F2 plants and found that dwarf F2 plants continued to generate dwarf plants in F3 and F 4 generations. He concluded that the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous — tt. What do you think he would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F2 plant? From the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the genotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F1 or F2 has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine the genotype of a tall plant at F2, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F2 with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an organism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead of self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to predict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 5.5 shows the results of typical test cross where Violet colour ﬂower (W) is dominant over white colour ﬂower (w). Using Punnett square, try to ﬁnd out the nature of offspring of a test cross. What ratio did you get? Using the genotypes of this cross, can you give a general deﬁnition for a test cross? 2019—2020",1

The key point to note here is that with this composting method, human excreta can be recycled into a resource (as natural fertiliser), which reduces the need for chemical fertilisers. There are working ‘EcoSan’ toilets in many areas of Kerala and Sri Lanka. 16.3 SOLID WASTES Solid wastes refer to everything that goes out in trash. Municipal solid wastes are wastes from homes, ofﬁces, stores, schools, hospitals, etc., that are collected and disposed by the municipality. The municipal solid wastes generally comprise paper, food wastes, plastics, glass, metals, rubber, leather, textile, etc. Burning reduces the volume of the wastes, although it is generally not burnt to completion and open dumps often serve as the breeding ground for rats and ﬂies. Sanitary landﬁlls were adopted as the substitute for open-burning dumps. In a sanitary landﬁll, wastes are dumped in a depression or trench after compaction, and covered with dirt everyday. If you live in a town or city, do you know where the nearest landﬁll site is? Landﬁlls are also not really much of a solution since the amount of garbage generation specially in the metros has increased so much that these sites are getting filled too. Also there is danger of seepage of chemicals, etc., from these landﬁlls polluting the underground water resources. A solution to all this can only be in human beings becoming more sensitive to these environment issues. All waste that we generate can be categorised into three types — (a) bio-degradable, (b) recyclable and (c) the non-biodegradable. It is important that all garbage generated is sorted. What can be reused or recycled should be separated out; our kabadiwallahs and rag-pickers do a great job of separation of materials for recycling. The biodegradable materials can be put into deep pits in the ground and be left for natural breakdown. That leaves only the non- biodegradable to be disposed off. The need to reduce our garbage generation should be a prime goal, instead, we are increasing the use of non-biodegradable products. Just pick any readymade packet of any ‘good quality’ eatable, say a biscuit packet, and study the packaging — do you see the number of protective layers used? Note that atleast one layer is of plastic. We have started packaging even our daily use products like milk and water in polybagsll In cities, fruits and vegetables can be bought packed in beautiful polysterene and plastic packaging — we pay so much and what do we do? Contribute heavily to environmental pollution. State Governments across the country are trying to push for reduction in use of plastics and use of eco-friendly packaging. We can do our bit by carrying cloth or other natural ﬁbre carry-bags when we go shopping and by refusing polythene bags. 2019-2020",1

Equation (4.34a) can be written in component form as l x = x0 + voxt + Eaxt2 l y 2 yo + voyt + ant2 (4.34b) One immediate interpretation of Eq.(4.34b) is that the motions in x- and ydirections can be treated independently of each other. That is, motion in a plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two separate simultaneous one-dimensional motions with constant acceleration along two perpendicular directions. This is an important result and is useful in analysing motion of objects in two dimensions. A similar result holds for three dimensions. The choice of perpendicular directions is convenient in many physical situations, as we shall see in section 4.10 for projectile motion. ’ Example 4.5 A particle starts from origin at t = O with a velocity 5.0 i m/s and moves in x—y plane under action of a force which produces a constant acceleration of (3.0i+2.0j) m/sz.

537,897,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION Cells at the end of prophase, when viewed under the microscope, do not show golgi complexes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus and the nuclear envelope. 10.2.2 Metaphase The complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope marks the start of the second phase of mitosis, hence the chromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell. By this stage, condensation of chromosomes is completed and they can be observed clearly under the microscope. This then, is the stage at which morphology of chromosomes is most easily studied. At this stage, metaphase chromosome is made up of two sister chromatids, which are held together by the centromere (Figure 10.2 b). Small disc-shaped structures at the surface of the centromeres are called kinetochores. These structures serve as the sites of attachment of spindle fibres (formed by the spindle ﬁbres) to the chromosomes that are moved into position at the centre of the cell. Hence, the metaphase is characterised by all the chromosomes coming to lie at the equator with one chromatid of each chromosome connected by its kinetochore to spindle ﬁbres from one pole and its sister chromatid connected by its kinetochore to spindle ﬁbres from the opposite pole (Figure 10.2 b). The plane of alignment of the chromosomes at metaphase is referred to as the metaphase plate. The key features of metaphase are: 0 Spindle fibres attach to kinetochores of chromosomes. 0 Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator and get aligned along metaphase plate through spindle ﬁbres to both poles. 10.2.3 Anaphase At the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at the metaphase plate is split simultaneously and the two daughter chromatids, now referred to as daughter chromosomes of the future daughter nuclei, begin their migration towards the two opposite poles. As each chromosome moves away ﬁom the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome remains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading edge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind (Figure 10.2 0). Thus, anaphase stage is characterised by Early Prophase Transition to Metaphase Metaphase (b) Figure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammatic View of stages in mitosis",1

539,1379,"188 BIOLOGY The transpiration driven ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on the following physical properties of water: ° Cohesion — mutual attraction between water molecules. ° Adhesion — attraction of water molecules to polar surfaces (such as the surface of tracheary elements). ° Surface Tension — water molecules are attracted to each other in the liquid phase more than to water in the gas phase. These properties give water high tensile strength, i.e., an ability to resist a pulling force, and high capillarity, i.e., the ability to rise in thin tubes. In plants capillarity is aided by the small diameter of the tracheary elements — the tracheids and vessel elements. The process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem vessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water. But what force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf parenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through the stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it results in pulling of water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the xylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular spaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a ‘pull’ (Figure 1 1.9). Measurements reveal that the forces generated by transpiration can create pressures sufﬁcient to lift a xylem sized column of water over 130 metres high. Palisade Stomatal Guard Cell pore Diffusion into surrounding air Figure11.9 Water movement in the leaf. Evaporation from the leaf sets up a pressure gradient between the outside air and the air spaces of the leaf.

The chromatin that is more densely packed and stains dark are called as Heterochromatin. Euchromatin is said to be transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is inactive. 6.2 THE SEARCH FOR GENETIC MATERIAL Even though the discovery of nuclein by Meischer and the proposition for principles of inheritance by Mendel were almost at the same time, but that the DNA acts as a genetic material took long to be discovered and proven. By 1926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic inheritance had reached the molecular level. Previous discoveries by Gregor Mendel, Walter Sutton, Thomas Hunt Morgan and numerous other scientists had narrowed the search to the chromosomes located in the nucleus of most cells. But the question of what molecule was actually the genetic material, had not been answered. Transforming Principle In 1928, Frederick Griffith, in a series of experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium responsible for pneumonia), witnessed a miraculous transformation in the bacteria. During the course of his experiment, a living organism (bacteria) had changed in physical form. When Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) bacteria are grown on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others produce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not.

The body bears eight external rows of ciliated comb plates, which help in locomotion (Figure 4.8). Digestion is both extracellular and intracellular. Bioluminescence (the property of a living organism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexes are not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexual means. Fertilisation is external with indirect development. Examples: Pleurobrachia and Ctenoplana. 4.2.4 Phylum - Platyhelminthes They have dorso-ventrally ﬂattened body, hence are called ﬂatworms (Figure 4.9). These are mostly endoparasites found in animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organ level of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in the parasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the host directly through their body surface. Specialised cells called ﬂame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are not separate. Fertilisation is internal and development is through many larval stages. Some members like Planaria possess high regeneration capacity. Examples: Taenia (Tapeworm), Fasciola (Liver ﬂuke).

544,1043,"Fusion of gametes Figure 1.7 individual (b) (a) Homogametic contact in alga; (b) Germinating pollen grains on the stigma of a ﬂower BIOLOGY In seed plants, pollen grains are the carriers of male gametes and ovule have the egg. Pollen grains produced in anthers therefore, have to be transferred to the stigma before it can lead to fertilisation (Figure 1 .7b). In bisexual, self-fertilising plants, e. g., peas, transfer of pollen grains to the stigma is relatively easy as anthers and stigma are located close to each other; pollen grains soon after they are shed, come in contact with the stigma. But in cross pollinating plants (including dioecious plants), a specialised event called pollination facilitates transfer of pollen grains to the stigma. Pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the pollen tubes carrying the male gametes reach the ovule and discharge male gametes near the egg. In dioecious animals, since male and female gametes are formed in different individuals, the organism must evolve a special mechanism for gamete transfer. Successful transfer and coming together of gametes is essential for the most critical event in sexual reproduction, the fertilisation. 1.2.2 Fertilisation The most vital event of sexual reproduction is perhaps the fusion of gametes. This process called syngamy results in the formation of a diploid zygote. The term fertilisation is also often used for this process. The terms syngamy and fertilisation are frequently used though , interchangeably. What would happen if syngamy does not occur? However, it has to be mentioned here that in some organisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards and birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes development to form new organisms without fertilisation. This phenomenon is called parthenogenesis. Where does syngamy occur? In most aquatic organisms, such as a majority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians, syngamy occurs in the external medium (water), i.e., outside the body of the organism. This type of gametic fusion is called external fertilisation. Organisms exhibiting external fertilisation show great synchrony between the sexes and release a large number of gametes into the surrounding medium (water) in order to enhance the chances of syngamy. This happens in the bony ﬁshes and frogs where a large number of offspring are produced. A major disadvantage is that the offspring are extremely vulnerable to predators threatening their survival up to adulthood. 2019-2020",1

A cup shaped bone called patella cover the knee ventrally (knee cap). Pectoral and Pelvic girdle bones help in the articulation of the upper and the lower limbs respectively with the axial skeleton. Each girdle is formed of two halves. Each half of pectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a scapula (Figure 20.9). Scapula is a large triangular ﬂat bone situated in the dorsal part of the thorax between the second and the seventh ribs. The dorsal, ﬂat, triangular body of scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called the spine which projects as a ﬂat, expanded process called the acromion. The clavicle articulates with this. Below the acromion is a depression called the glenoid cavity which articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder j oint. Each clavicle is a long slender bone with two curvatures. This bone is commonly called the collar bone. Pelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones (Figure 20.10). Each coxal bone is formed by the fusion of three bones — ilium, ischium and pubis.

This inﬂuence is mathematically expressed as where x, a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the magnetic susceptibility. It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an external field. Table 5.2 lists xfor some elements. It is small and positive for materials, which are called paramagnetic.

548,979,"/ .3) The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 20 1 7 was enacted by the govemment of India with the intension of reducing the incidence of illegal abortion and consequent maternal mortality and morbidity. According to this Act, a pregnancy may be terminated on certain considered grounds within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy on the opinion of one registered medical practitioner. If the pregnancy has lasted more than 12 weeks, but fewer than 24 weeks, two registered medical practitioners must be of the opinion, formed in good faith, that the required ground exist. The grounds for such termination of pregnancies are: (i) The continuation of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury physical or mental health; or (ii There is a substantial risk that of the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. BIOLOGY pregnancies. Surgical intervention blocks gamete transport and thereby prevent conception. Sterilisation procedure in the male is called ‘vasectomy’ and that in the female, ‘tubectomy’. In vasectomy, a small part of the vas deferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum (Figure 4.4a) whereas in tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is removed (Figure 4.4b) or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen or through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their reversibility is very poor. It needs to be emphasised that the selection of a suitable contraceptive method and its use should always be undertaken in consultation with qualified medical professionals. One must also remember that contraceptives are not regular requirements for the maintenance of reproductive health. In fact, they are practiced against a natural reproductive event, i.e., conception / pregnancy. One is forced to use these methods either to prevent pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy due to personal reasons. No doubt, the widespread use of these methods have a signiﬁcant role in checking uncontrolled growth of population. However, their possible ill-effects like nausea, abdominal pain, breakthrough bleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding or even breast cancer, though not very significant, should not be totally ignored. 4.3 MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY (MTP) Intentional or voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term is called medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) or induced abortion. Nearly 45 to 50 million MTPs are performed in a year all over the world which accounts to 1 / 5th of the total number of conceived pregnancies in a year. Whether to accept / legalise MTP or not is being debated upon in many countries due to emotional, ethical, religious and social issues involved in it. Government of India legalised MTP in 197 1 with some strict conditions to avoid its misuse. Such restrictions are all the more important to check indiscriminate and illegal female foeticides which are reported to be high in India. Why MTP ? Obviously the answer is—to get rid of unwanted pregnancies either due to casual unprotected intercourse or failure of the contraceptive used during coitus or rapes. MTPs are also essential in certain cases where continuation of the pregnancy could be harmful or even fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or both. MTPs are considered relatively safe during the ﬁrst trimester, i.e., upto 12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions are much more riskier. One disturbing trend observed is that a majority of the MIPS are performed illegally by unqualiﬁed quacks which are not only unsafe but could be fatal too. Another dangerous trend is the misuse of amniocentesis to determine the sex of the unborn child. Frequently, if the foetus is found to be female, it is followed by MTP- this is totally against what is legal. 2019-2020",1

We can try to understand its complexity by investigating processes at various levels of biological organisation—macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs, individual organisms, population, communities, ecosystems and biomes. At any level of biological organisation we can ask two types of questions — for example, when we hear the bulbul singing early morning in the garden, we may ask — ‘How does the bird sing?’ Or, ‘Why does the bird sing ?’ The ‘how—type’ questions seek the mechanism behind the process while the ‘why- type’ questions seek the signiﬁcance of the process. For the ﬁrst question in our example, the answer might be in terms of the operation of the voice box and the vibrating bone in the bird, whereas for the second question the answer may lie in the bird’s need to communicate with its mate during breeding season. When you observe nature around you with a scientific frame of mind you will certainly come up with many interesting questions of both types - Why are night-blooming ﬂowers generally white?

The angle between tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact and solid surface inside the liquid is termed as angle of contact. It is denoted by 0. It is different at interfaces of different pairs of liquids and solids. The value of 6 determines whether a liquid will spread on the surface of a solid or it will form droplets on it.

Vast, distant galaxies, the tiny invisible atoms, humans and beasts all are permeated through and through with a host of magnetic ﬁelds from a variety of sources. The earth’s magnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from the name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore deposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island complained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed struck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This attractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around. The directional property of magnets was also known since ancient times. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in the north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed on a piece of cork which was then allowed to ﬂoat in still water. The name lodestone (or loadstone) given to a naturally occurring ore of iron- magnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this property is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400 BC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans crossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles. A Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti about four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen (whom 2019-20",0

Multiplying both sides by m/ 2, we have 1 2 1 2 —mv ——mu =mas=Fs , 2 2 (6 2a) where the last step follows from Newton’s Second Law. We can generalise Eq. (6.2) to three dimensions by employing vectors v2— u2= 2 a.d Here a and d are acceleration and displacement vectors of the object respectively. Once again multiplying both sides by m/ 2 , we obtain 1 2 l Emu Emu2 = m a.d = F.d (6,2b) The above equation provides a motivation for the definitions of work and kinetic energy. The left side of the equation is the difference in the quantity ‘half the mass times the square of the speed’ from its initial value to its final value. We call each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’, denoted by K. The right side is a product of the displacement and the component of the force along the displacement. This quantity is called ‘work’ and is denoted by W. Eq. (6.2b) is then Kf— K: W (6.3) where K. and Kf are respectively the initial and final kinetic energies of the object. Work refers to the force and the displacement over which it acts. Work is done by a force on the body over a certain displacement. Equation (6.2) is also a special case of the work-energy (WE) theorem : The change in kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the work done on it by the net force. We shall generalise the above derivation to a varying force in a later section. b Example 6.2 It is well known that a raindrop falls under the inﬂuence of the downward gravitational force and the opposing resistive force. The latter is known 2019-20 to be proportional to the speed of the drop but is otherwise undetermined. Consider a drop of mass 1.00 g falling from a height 1.00 km. It hits the ground with a speed of 50.0 m s ’. (a) What is the work done by the gravitational force ? What is the work done by the unknown resistive force? Answer (a) The change in kinetic energy of the drop is AK=lmv2 —O 2 1 —3 25x10 x50><50 =1.25J where we have assumed that the drop is initially at rest. Assuming that g is a constant with a value 10 m / s2, the work done by the gravitational force is, W = mgh 9 = 10'3 x10 ><103 = 10.0 J (b) From the work-energy theorem AK : Wg + Wr where WT is the work done by the resistive force on the raindrop. Thus Wr = AK — W9 = 1.25 — 10 = — 8.75 J is negative. 4 6.3 WORK As seen earlier, work is related to force and the displacement over which it acts.

For L = 30 cm and v = 330 m S'l, the fundamental frequency of the pipe closed at one end is 275 Hz and the source frequency corresponds to its fourth harmonic.

Neither stationary charges nor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of electromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic ﬁelds, while the latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time. It is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond the scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough, qualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency. (An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.) This produces an oscillating electric ﬁeld in space, which produces an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the frequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the propagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source — the accelerated charge. From the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all we needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate at the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not possible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 X 1014 Hz, while the frequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about 1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic wave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio wave region), as in the Hertz’s experiment (1887). Hertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s theory created a sensation and sparked off other important works in this field. Two important achievements in this connection deserve mention.

Nimbus clouds are shapeless masses of thick vapour. Figure 11.2 Identify these cloud types which are shown in Figure 11.1 and 11.2. A combination of these four basic types can give rise to the following types of clouds: high clouds — cirrus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus; middle clouds — altostratus and altocumulus; low clouds — stratocumulus and nimbostratus and clouds with extensive vertical development— cumulus and cumulonimbus. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Precipitation The process of continuous condensation in free air helps the condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall on to the earth’s surface. 80 after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation. This may take place in liquid or solid form. The precipitation in the form of water is called rainfall, when the temperature is lower than the DOC, precipitation takes place in the form of fine ﬂakes of snow and is called snowfall. Moisture is released in the form of hexagonal crystals. These crystals form ﬂakes of snow. Besides rain and snow, other forms of precipitation are sleet and hail, though the latter are limited in occurrence and are sporadic in both time and space. Sleet is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow-water. When a layer of air with the temperature above freezing point overlies a subfreezing layer near the ground, precipitation takes place in the form of sleet. Raindrops, which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below. As a result, they solidify and reach the ground as small pellets of ice not bigger than the raindrops from which they are formed. Sometimes, drops of rain after being released by the clouds become solidified into small rounded solid pieces of ice and which reach the surface of the earth are called hailstones. These are formed by the rainwater passing through the colder layers. Hailstones have several concentric layers of ice one over the other. Types of Rainfall On the basis of origin, rainfall may be classiﬁed into three main types — the convectional, orographic or relief and the cyclonic or frontal. Convectional Rain The, air on being heated, becomes light and rises up in convection currents. As it rises, it expands and loses heat and consequently, condensation takes place and cumulous clouds are formed. With thunder and lightening, heavy rainfall takes place but this does not last 2019-2020",2

J} BIOLOGY There are three major ways in which different cells handle pyruvic acid produced by glycolysis. These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation and aerobic respiration. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. For the complete oxidation of glucose to CO2 and H20, however, organisms adopt Krebs’ cycle which is also called as aerobic respiration. This requires 02 supply. 14.3 FERMENTATION In fermentation, say by yeast, the incomplete oxidation of glucose is achieved under anaerobic conditions by sets of reactions where pyruvic acid is converted to CO2 and ethanol. The enzymes, pyruvic acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase catalyse these reactions. Other organisms like some bacteria produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid. The steps involved are shown in Figure 14.2. In animal cells also, like muscles during exercise, when oxygen is inadequate for cellular respiration pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase. The reducing agent is NADH+H+ which is reoxidised to NAD+ in both the processes. In both lactic acid and alcohol fermentation not much energy is released; less than seven per cent of the energy in glucose is released and not all of it is trapped as high energy bonds of ATP. Also, the processes are hazardous — either acid or alcohol is produced. What is the net ATPs that is synthesised (calculate how many ATP are synthesised and deduct the number of ATP utilised during glycolysis) when one molecule of glucose is fermented to alcohol or lactic acid?

The significance of a mode depends on the type of goods and services to be transported, costs of transport and the mode available. International movement of goods is handled by ocean freighters. Road transport is cheaper and faster over short distances and for door-to- door services. Railways are most suited for large volumes of bulky materials over long distances within a country. High-value, light and perishable goods are best moved by airways.

Land Transport transportation and large freighters are the cheapest. They are important in supplementing modern channels and carriers which penetrate the interiors in large countries. In the densely populated districts of India and China, overland transport still takes place by human porters or carts drawn or pushed by humans. 5;]; Most of the movement of goods and services takes place over land. In early days, humans themselves were carriers. Have you ever seen a bride being carried on a palanquin (palki/doli) by four persons (Kahars in north India).

Some materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and chromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature (Fig. 3.10). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These materials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since their resistance values would change very little with temperatures. Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with increasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.1 1. We can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of resistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation, resistivity of a material is given by _1_ m _—_ 2 0' net (3.27) p thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit volume and on the average time 1' between collisions. As we increase temperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of current, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time of collisions I, thus decreases with temperature. In a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable extent and thus the decrease in the value of T with rise in temperature causes p to increase as we have observed. For insulators and semiconductors, however, n increases with temperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in 1: in Eq.(3.23) so that for such materials, p decreases with temperature. 2019-20",0

These ‘engineers’ built a chariot on which they placed a magnetic figure with arms outstretched. Figure 5.1 is an artist’s description of this chariot. The figure swiveled around so that the finger of the statuette on it always pointed south. With this chariot, Huang-ti’s troops were able to attack the enemy from the rear in thick fog, and to defeat them. In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric currents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the early part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot and Savart, among others. In the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its own right. Some of the commonly known ideas regarding of the earliest known compasses. magnetism are: 174 thousands of years old. (i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing approximately from the geographic south to the north. (ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in the north-south direction. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the north pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called the south pole of the magnet. (iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two magnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive force between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of the other. (iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet is broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with somewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic north and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist. (v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys. We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an external magnetic field. We describe Gauss’s law of magnetism. We then follow it up with an account of the earth’s magnetic field. We next describe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism. We conclude with a section on electromagnets and permanent magnets. 5.2 THE BAR MAGNET One of the earliest childhood memories of the famous physicist Albert Einstein was that of a magnet gifted to him by a relative. Einstein was fascinated, and played endlessly with it. He wondered how the magnet could affect objects such as nails or pins placed away from it and not in any way connected to it by a spring or string. 2019-20",0

However, for the sake of convenience, initially individual accounts are opened for each instalment. All money received along with application is deposited with a scheduled bank in a separate account opened for the purpose. The joumal entry is as follows: Bank A/c Dr. To Share Application A/c (Amount received on application for — shares @ Rs. per share) On allotment :When minimum subscription has been received and certain legal formalities on the allotment of shares have been duly compiled with, the directors of the company proceed to make the allotment of shares. The allotment of shares implies a contract between the company and the applicants who now become the allottees and assume the status of shareholders or members. Allotment of Shares (Implications from accounting point of view) It is customary to ask for some amount called “Allotment Money"" from the allottees on the shares allotted to them as soon as the allotment is made. With the acceptance to the offer made by the applicants, the amount of application money received has to be transferred to share capital account as it has formally become the part of the same. The money received on rejected applications should either be fully returned to the applicant within period prescribed by law/SEBI. In case lesser number of shares have to be allotted. than those applied for the excess application money must be adjusted towards the amount due on allotment from the allottees. The effect of the later two steps is to close the share application account which is only a temporary account for share capital transactions.",3
576,1253,"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION Although India has only 2.4 per cent of the world’s land area, its share of the global species diversity is an impressive 8.1 per cent. That is what makes our country one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world. Nearly 45,000 species of plants and twice as many of animals have been recorded from India. How many living species are actually there waiting to be discovered and named? If we accept May’s global estimates, only 22 per cent of the total species have been recorded so far. Applying this proportion to India’s diversity ﬁgures, we estimate that there are probably more than 1,00,000 plant species and more than 3,00,000 animal species yet to be discovered and described. Would we ever be able to complete the inventory of the biological wealth of our country? Consider the immense trained manpower (taxonomists) and the time required to complete the job. The situation appears more hopeless when we realise that a large fraction of these species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them. Nature’s biological library is burning even before we catalogued the titles of all the books stocked there. 15. 1.2 Patterns of Biodiversity (i) Latitudinal gradients: The diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world but shows a rather uneven distribution. For many group of animals or plants, there are interesting patterns in diversity, the most well- known being the latitudinal gradient in diversity. In general, species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the poles. With very few exceptions, tropics (latitudinal range of 23.5° N to 235° S) harbour more species than temperate or polar areas. Colombia located near the equator has nearly 1,400 species of birds while New York at 41° N has 105 species and Greenland at 71° N only 56 species. India, with much of its land area in the tropical latitudes, has more than 1,200 species of birds. A forest in a tropical region like Equador has up to 10 times as many species of vascular plants as a forest of equal area in a temperate region like the Midwest of the USA. The largely tropical Amazonian rain forest in South America has the greatest biodiversity on earth- it is home to more than 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of ﬁshes, 1,300 of birds, 427 of mammals, 427 of amphibians, 37 8 of reptiles and of more than 1 ,25,000 invertebrates. Scientists estimate that in these rain forests there might be at least two million insect species waiting to be discovered and named. What is so special about tropics that might account for their greater biological diversity? Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have proposed various hypotheses; some important ones are (a) Speciation is generally a function of time, unlike temperate regions subjected to frequent glaciations in the past, tropical latitudes have remained relatively undisturbed for millions of years and thus, had a long 2019-2020",1

Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of nodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition called hyperthyroidism which adversely affects the body physiology. Exopthalmic goitre is a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised by enlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increased basal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called Graves’ disease. Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell formation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also inﬂuenced by thyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called thyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels. 22.2.5 Parathyroid Gland In humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the thyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure 22.3b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the circulating levels of calcium ions. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca2+ levels in the blood. PTH acts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/ demineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ by the renal tubules and increases Ca2+ absorption from the digested food. It is, thus, clear that PI‘H is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood Ca2+ levels. Along with TCT, it plays a signiﬁcant role in calcium balance in the body. 22.2.6 Thymus The thymus gland is a lobular structure located between lungs behind sternum on the ventral side of aorta. The thymus plays a major role in the development of the immune system. This gland secretes the peptide hormones called thymosins. Thymosins play a major role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins also promote production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity.

Over many years, this will result in a rise in sea level that can submerge many coastal areas. The total spectrum of changes that global warming can bring about is a subject that is still under active research. How can we control global warming? The measures include cutting down use of fossil fuel, improving efﬁciency of energy usage, reducing deforestation, planting trees and slowing down the growth of human population. International initiatives are also being taken to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 16.7 OZONE DEPLETION IN THE STRATo- SPHERE You have earlier studied in the Chemistry textbook of Class XI about ‘bad’ ozone, formed in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) that harms plants and animals. There is ‘good’ ozone also; this ozone is found in the upper part of the atmosphere called the stratosphere, and it acts as a shield absorbing ultraviolet radiation from the sun. UV rays are highly injurious to living organisms since DNA and proteins of living organisms preferentially absorb UV rays, and its high energy breaks the chemical bonds within these molecules. The thickness of the ozone in a column of air from the ground to the top of the atmosphere is measured in terms of Dobson Figure 16.8 Ozone hole is the area above Antarctica, shown in purple colour, where the ozone layer is the thinnest. Ozone thickness is given in Dobson unit (see carefully the scale units (DU). Ozone gas is continuously formed by the action of UV rays on molecular oxygen, and also shown in colour violet to red). The ozone hole over Antarctica develops each year between late August and early October. Courtesy: NASA degraded into molecular oxygen in the stratosphere. There should be a balance between production and degradation of ozone in the stratosphere. Of late, the balance has been disrupted due to enhancement of ozone degradation by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs ﬁnd wide use as refrigerants. CFCs discharged in the lower part of atmosphere move upward and reach stratosphere. In stratosphere, UV rays act on them releasing Cl atoms. Cl degrades ozone releasing molecular oxygen, with these atoms acting merely as catalysts; Cl atoms are not consumed in the reaction.

The situations (1) and (2) differ from each other because of the absence or presence of relative motion between the observer and the medium. Most waves require a medium for their propagation; however, electromagnetic waves do not require any medium for propagation. If there is no medium present, the Doppler shifts are same irrespective of whether the source moves or the observer moves, since there is no way of distinction between the two situations. 15.8. 1 Source Moving ; Observer Stationary Let us choose the convention to take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction of velocity.

We assume that the observer has a detector that counts every time a wave crest reaches it.

Each translational and rotational degree of freedom corresponds to one energy mode of absorption and has energy 1/2 k3 T. Each vibrational frequency has two modes of energy (kinetic and potential) with corresponding energy equal to 2 X 1/2 kBT= kBT. Using the law of equipartition of energy, the molar specific heats of gases can be determined and the values are in agreement with the experimental values of specific heats of several gases. The agreement can be improved by including vibrational modes of motion. The mean free path lis the average distance covered by a molecule between two successive collisions : l x/Enﬂ'd2 where n is the number density and d the diameter of the molecule. 1: POINTS TO PONDER 1. Pressure of a ﬂuid is not only exerted on the wall. Pressure exists everywhere in a ﬂuid. Any layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure is the same on both sides of the layer. We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At ordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance in solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100 times the interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule. The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energl for each degree of freedom in thermal equilibrium is 1/2 kB T. Each quadratic term in the total energl expression of a molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives 2 (not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energl modes), corresponding to the energ] 2 X 1/2 kB T= kB T. Molecules of air in a room do not all fall and settle on the ground (due to gravity) because of their high speeds and incessant collisions.

584,894,"STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCEMENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION Wheat and Rice: During the period 1960 to 2000, wheat production increased from 1 1 million tonnes to 75 million tonnes while rice production went up from 35 million tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes. This was due to the development of semi-dwarf varieties of wheat and rice. Nobel laureate Norman E. Borlaug, at International Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement in Mexico, developed semi-dwarf wheat. In 1963, several varieties such as Sonalika and Kalyan Sona, which were high yielding and disease resistant, were introduced all over the wheat-growing belt of India. Semi-dwarf rice varieties were derived from IR—8, (developed at International Rice Research Institute ﬂRRI), Philippines) and Taichung Native-1 (from Taiwan). The derivatives were introduced in 1966. Later better-yielding semi- dwarf varieties Jaya and Ratna were developed in India. Sugar cane: Saccharum barberi was originally grown in north India, but had poor sugar content and yield. Tropical canes grown in south India Saccharum ofﬁcinarum had thicker stems and higher sugar content but did not grow well in north India. These two species were successfully crossed to get sugar cane varieties combining the desirable qualities of high yield, thick stems, high sugar and ability to grow in the sugar cane areas of north India. Millets: Hybrid maize, j owar and bajra have been successfully developed in India. Hybrid breeding have led to the development of several high yielding van'eties resistant to water stress. 9.2.2 Plant Breeding for Disease Resistance A wide range of fungal, bacterial and Viral pathogens, affect the yield of cultivated crop species, especially in tropical climates. Crop losses can often be signiﬁcant, up to 20-30 per cent, or sometimes even total. In this situation, breeding and development of cultivars resistant to disease enhances food production. This also helps reduce the dependence on use of fungicides and bacteriocides. Resistance of the host plant is the ability to prevent the pathogen from causing disease and is determined by the genetic constitution of the host plant. Before breeding is undertaken, it is important to know about the causative organism and the mode of transmission. Some of the diseases caused by fungi are rusts, e. g., brown rust of wheat, red rot of sugarcane and late blight of potato; by bacteria—black rot of crucifers; and by Viruses—tobacco mosaic, turnip mosaic, etc. Methods of breeding for disease resistance: Breeding is carried out by the conventional breeding techniques (described earlier) or by mutation breeding. The conventional method of breeding for disease resistance is that of hybridisation and selection. It’s steps are essentially identical to those for breeding for any other agronomic characters such as high yield. The various sequential steps are : screening germplasm 2019-2020 I73",1

When a negligibly small current passes through it, its resistance at room temperature (27 .0 °C) is found to be 75.3 Q. When the toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after a few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady temperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range involved, is 1.70 X 10‘4 °C“1. Solution When the current through the element is very small, heating effects can be ignored and the temperature T1 of the element is the same as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the supply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value of 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature will rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight decrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached when temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the element and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The resistance R2 at the steady temperature T2 is 230V R2 =2.68A Using the relation R2=R1 [1 + a(T2—T1)] with a = 1.70 X 10’4 °C’1, we get = 85.8 $2 TNTM =8200C H (75.3)X1.70><10 that is, T2 = (820 + 27.0) °C = 847 °C g Thus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating E effect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is 9° 847 °C. 09 Example 3.4 The resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum resistance thermometer at the ice point is 5 S2 and at steam point is 5.39 Q.

Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 purely by accident. While studying the ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence of compounds irradiated with visible light, Becquerel observed an interesting phenomenon. After illuminating some pieces of uranium-potassium sulphate with visible light, he wrapped them in black paper and separated the package from a photographic plate by a piece of silver. When, after several hours of exposure, the photographic plate was developed, it showed blackening due to something that must have been emitted by the compound and was able to penetrate both black paper and the silver. Experiments performed subsequently showed that radioactivity was a nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes a decay. This is referred to as radioactive decay. Three types of radioactive decay occur in nature : (i) OL-decay in which a helium nucleus :He is emitted; (ii) B-decay in which electrons or positrons (particles with the same mass as electrons, but with a charge exactly opposite to that of electron) are emitted; (iii) y—decay in which high energy (hundreds of keV or more) photons are emitted. Each of these decay will be considered in subsequent sub-sections. 13.6. 1 Law of radioactive decay In any radioactive sample, which undergoes on, B or Y—decay, it is found that the number of nuclei undergoing the decay per unit time is proportional to the total number of nuclei in the sample. If N is the number of nuclei in the sample and AN undergo decay in time At then MKN At or, AN/At=7LN, (13.10) where 7L is called the radioactive decay constant or disintegration constant. The change in the number of nuclei in the sample* is dN = — AN in time At. Thus the rate of change of N is (in the limit At a 0) dt * AN is the number of nuclei that decay, and hence is always positive. dN is the change in N, which may have either sign. Here it is negative, because out of original N nuclei, AN have decayed, leaving (N—AN) nuclei. 2019-20",0

The major components of our food are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Vitamins and minerals are also required in small quantities. Food provides energy and organic materials for growth and repair of tissues. The water we take in, plays an important role in metabolic processes and also prevents dehydration of the body. Biomacromolecules in food cannot be utilised by our body in their original form. They have to be broken down and converted into simple substances in the digestive system. This process of conversion of complex food substances to simple absorbable forms is called digestion and is carried out by our digestive system by mechanical and biochemical methods. General organisation of the human digestive system is shown in Figure 16.1. 16. 1 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and the associated glands. 16. 1. l Alimentary Canal The alimentary canal begins with an anterior opening — the mouth, and it opens out posteriorly through the anus. The mouth leads to the buccal cavity or oral cavity. The oral cavity has a number of teeth and a muscular tongue. Each tooth is embedded in a socket of jaw bone (Figure16.2). This type of attachment is called thecodont. Majority of mammals including human being forms two sets of teeth during their life, a set of temporary milk or deciduous teeth replaced by a set of permanent or adult teeth.

Acrosome Nucleus containing chromosomal material Let us examine the structure of a sperm. It is a microscopic structure composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and a tail (Figure 3.6). A plasma membrane envelops the whole body of sperm. The sperm head contains an elongated Neck haploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which Middle piece Mitochondria (energy source for swimming) Tail Figure 3.6 Structure of a sperm is covered by a cap-like structure, acrosome. The acrosome is ﬁlled with enzymes that help fertilisation of the ovum. The middle piece possesses numerous mitochondria, which produce energy for the movement of tail that facilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation. The human male ejaculates about 200 to 300 million sperms during a coitus of which, for normal fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms must have normal shape and size and at least 40 per cent of them must show vigorous motility. Sperms released from the seminiferous tubules, are transported by the accessory ducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal plasma along with the sperms constitute the semen. The functions of male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular hormones (androgens). The process of formation of a mature female gamete is called oogenesis which is markedly different from sperrnatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete mother cells (oogonia) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia are formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into prophase—I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage, called primary oocytes. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle (Figure 3.7). A large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca and are called secondary follicles. The secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is characterised by a ﬂuid ﬁlled cavity called antrum. The theca layer is organised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is important to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its ﬁrst meiotic division. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large haploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body (Figure 3.8b). The 2019-2020",1
591,812,"BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION bicuspid valves due to attempted backﬂow of blood into the atria. As the ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding the pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open, allowing the blood in the ventricles to ﬂow through these vessels into the circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole) and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves which prevents the backﬂow of blood into the ventricles. As the ventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which was being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again moves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in a relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new action potential and the events described above are repeated in that sequence and the process continues. This sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called the cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria and ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times per minute, i.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could be deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood which is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume multiplied by the heart rate (no. of beats per min.) gives the cardiac output. Therefore, the cardiac output can be deﬁned as the volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle per minute and averages 5000 mL or 5 litres in a healthy individual. The body has the ability to alter the stroke volume as well as the heart rate and thereby the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output of an athlete will be much higher than that of an ordinary man. During each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which can be easily heard through a stethoscope. The ﬁrst heart sound (lub) is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas the second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the semilunar valves. These sounds are of clinical diagnostic signiﬁcance. 18.3.3 Electrocardiograph (ECG) You are probably familiar with this scene from a typical hospital television show: A patient is hooked up to a monitoring machine that shows voltage traces on a screen and makes the sound .. pip... pip... pip ..... peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” as the patient goes into cardiac arrest.

593,1376,"EVOLUTION has built in variation in characteristics. Those characteristics which enable some to survive better in natural conditions (climate, food, physical factors, etc.) would outbreed others that are less-endowed to survive under such natural conditions. Another word used is ﬁtness of the individual or population. The fitness, according to Darwin, refers ultimately and only to reproductive ﬁtness. Hence, those who are better ﬁt in an environment, leave more progeny than others. These, therefore, will survive more and hence are selected by nature. He called it natural selection and implied it as a mechanism of evolution. Let us also remember that Alfred Wallace, a naturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago had also come to similar conclusions around the same time. In due course of time, apparently new types of organisms are recognisable. All the existing life forms share similarities and share common ancestors. However, these ancestors were present at different periods in the history of earth (epochs, periods and eras). The geological history of earth closely correlates with the biological history of earth. A common permissible conclusion is that earth is very old, not thousand of years as was thought earlier but billions of years old. 7.3 WHAT ARE THE EVIDENCES FOR EVOLUTION? Evidence that evolution of life forms has indeed taken place on earth has come from many quarters. Fossils are remains of hard parts of life-forms found in rocks. Rocks form sediments and a cross-section of earth's crust indicates the arrangement of sediments one over the other during the long history of earth. Different-aged rock sediments contain fossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of the particular sediment. Some of them appear similar to modern organisms (Figure 7 .2). They represent extinct organisms (e. g., Dinosaurs). A study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological period in which they existed. The study showed that life-forms varied over time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time- spans. Hence, new forms of life have arisen at different times in the history of earth. All this is called paleontological evidence. Do you remember how the ages of the fossils are calculated? Do you recollect the method of radioactive-dating and the principles behind the procedure? Embryological support for evolution was also proposed by Ernst Heckel based upon the observation of certain features during embryonic stage common to all vertebrates that are absent in adult. For example, the embryos of all vertebrates including human develop a row of vestigial gill slit just behind the head but it is a functional organ only in ﬁsh and not found in any other adult vertebrates. However, this proposal was disapproved on careful study performed by Karl Ernst von Baer. He noted that embryos never pass through the adult stages of other animals. Comparative anatomy and morphology shows similarities and differences among organisms of today and those that existed years ago. 2019-2020",1
594,1306,"218 BIOLOGY Hence for every CO2 molecule entering the Calvin cycle, 3 molecules of ATP and 2 of NADPH are required. It is probably to meet this difference in number of ATP and NADPH used in the dark reaction that the cyclic phosphorylation takes place. To make one molecule of glucose 6 turns of the cycle are required. Work out how many ATP and NADPH molecules will be required to make one molecule of glucose through the Calvin pathway. It might help you to understand all of this if we look at what goes in and what comes out of the Calvin cycle. 13.8 THE C4 PATHWAY Plants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C 4 pathway mentioned earlier. Though these plants have the C 4 oxaloacetic acid as the ﬁrst CO2 ﬁxation product they use the C3 pathway or the Calvin cycle as the main biosynthetic pathway. Then, in what way are they different from C3 plants? This is a question that you may reasonably ask. C 4 plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities, they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity of biomass. Let us understand these one by one. Study vertical sections of leaves, one of a C3 plant and the other of a C 4 plant. Do you notice the differences? Do both have the same types of mesophylls? Do they have similar cells around the vascular bundle sheath? The particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C 4 plants are called bundle sheath cells, and the leaves which have such anatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy. ‘Kranz’ means ‘wreath’ and is a reﬂection of the arrangement of cells. The bundle sheath cells may form several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised by having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to gaseous exchange and no intercellular spaces. You may like to cut a section of the leaves of C 4 plants — maize or sorghum — to observe the Kranz anatomy and the distribution of mesophyll cells. It would be interesting for you to collect leaves of diverse species of plants around you and cut vertical sections of the leaves. Observe under the microscope — look for the bundle sheath around the vascular bundles. The presence of the bundle sheath would help you identify the C 4 plants.",1
595,1461,"92 Thunderstorms and Tornadoes Other severe local storms are thunderstorms and tornadoes. They are of short duration, occurring over a small area but are violent. Thunderstorms are caused by intense convection on moist hot days. A thunderstorm is a well-grown cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder and lightening. When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. If there is insufﬁcient moisture, a thunderstorm can generate dust- storms. A thunderstorm is characterised by intense updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise to FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY greater height. This causes precipitation. Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and the rain. From severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends like a trunk of an elephant with great force, with very low pressure at the centre, causing massive destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon is called a tornado. Tornadoes generally occur in middle latitudes. The tornado over the sea is called water spouts. These violent storms are the manifestation of the atmosphere’s adjustments to varying energy distribution. The potential and heat energies are converted into kinetic energy in these storms and the restless atmosphere again returns to its stable state. m, EXERCISES 7 1. Multiple choice questions.

597,548,"Electromagnetic Waves same (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out of a value of 3X108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in vacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is so well known now that this is used to define a standard of length. Namely, the metre is now deﬁned as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in a time (1 /c) seconds = (299792458 X 108)‘1 seconds. This has come about for the following reason. The basic unit of time can be defined very accurately in terms of some atomic frequency, i.e., frequency of light emitted by an atom in a particular process. The basic unit of length is harder to define as accurately in a direct way. Earlier measurement of c using earlier units of length (metre rods, etc.) converged to a value of about 2.9979246 X 108 m/s. Since c is such a strongly fixed number, unit of length can be defined in terms of c and the unit of time! Hertz not only showed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but also demonstrated that the waves, which had wavelength ten million times that of the light waves, could be diffracted, refracted and polarised. Thus, he conclusively established the wave nature of the radiation. Further, he produced stationary electromagnetic waves and determined their wavelength by measuring the distance between two successive nodes. Since the frequency of the wave was known (being equal to the frequency of the oscillator), he obtained the speed of the wave using the formula = wt and found that the waves travelled with the same speed as the speed of light. The fact that electromagnetic waves are polarised can be easily seen in the response of a portable AM radio to a broadcasting station. If an AM radio has a telescopic antenna, it responds to the electric part of the signal. When the antenna is turned horizontal, the signal will be greatly diminished. Some portable radios have horizontal antenna (usually inside the case of radio), which are sensitive to the magnetic component of the electromagnetic wave. Such a radio must remain horizontal in order to receive the signal. In such cases, response also depends on the orientation of the radio with respect to the station. Do electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum like other waves? Yes, they do. We have seen in chapter 2 that in a region of free space with electric field E, there is an energy density (sOEZ / 2). Similarly, as seen in Chapter 6, associated with a magnetic field B is a magnetic energy density (B2/ 2%). As electromagnetic wave contains both electric and magnetic fields, there is a non-zero energy density associated with it. Now consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave (Fig. 8.4). If there are, on this plane, electric charges, they will be set and sustained in motion by the electric and magnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave. The charges thus acquire energy and momentum from the waves. This just illustrates the fact that an electromagnetic wave (like other waves) carries energy and momentum. Since it carries momentum, an electromagnetic wave also exerts pressure, called radiation pressure. If the total energy transferred to a surface in time tis U, it can be shown that the magnitude of the total momentum delivered to this surface (for complete absorption) is, U 2019-20",0
598,857,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 10.3 Signiﬁcance of Mitosis Mitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells only. However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploid cells also divide by mitosis. It is very essential to understand the signiﬁcance of this division in the life of an organism. Are you aware of some examples where you have studied about haploid and diploid insects? Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells with identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organisms is due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell to divide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significant contribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of the epidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly replaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues — the apical and the lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughout their life. 10.4 MEIOSIS The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes are formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the production of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called meiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid phase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and animals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features of meiosis are as follows: 0 Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called meiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication. 0 Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated to produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase. 0 Meiosis involves pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. 0 Four haploid cells are formed at the end of meiosis II. Meiotic events can be grouped under the following phases:",1

601,576,"Electric Charges and Fields neutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named as positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin. We know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of the same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the philosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be electrically neutral. UNIFICATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM In olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity dealt with charges on glass rods, cat’s fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism described interactions of magnets, iron ﬁlings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish scientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deﬂected by passing an electric current through a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation by saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets generate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell and the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the interdependence of these two subjects. This field is called electromagnetism Most of the phenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually every force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the matter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living organisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces of nature. Maxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism as Newton’s equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics. He also argued that light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely electric and magnetic measurements. He claimed that the science of optics is intimately related to that of electricity and magnetism. The science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological civilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety of the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science. Although charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the frame of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You know that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance between the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as the square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter that electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force by several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook). A simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf electroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge ﬂows on to the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of the amount of charge. 3 2019-20",0

Digestive system is complete with mouth on the lower (ventral) side and anus on the upper (dorsal) side. The most distinctive feature of echinoderms is the presence of water vascular system which helps in locomotion, capture and transport of food and respiration. An excretory system is absent. Sexes are separate. Reproduction is sexual. Fertilisation is usually external. Development is indirect with free-swimming larva.

But now it is placed as a separate phylum under non-Chordata. Hemichordates have a rudimentary structure in the collar region called stomochord, a structure similar to notochord. This phylum consists of a small group of worm-like marine animals with organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate animals. The body is cylindrical and is composed of an anterior proboscis, a collar and a long trunk (Figure 4. 15). Circulatory system is of open type. Respiration takes place through gills.

603,831,"MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE would be favoured energetically. The presence of a catalyst would enhance 7 the rate of peptide bond formation. Growing polypeptide chain E The cellular factory responsible for synthesising proteins is the ribosome. The ribosome consists of structural RNAs and about 80 different proteins. In its inactive state, it exists as two subunits; a large subunit and a small subunit. When the small subunit encounters an mRNA, the process of C U C U U G translation of the mRNA to protein 5' begins. There are two sites in the large subunit, for subsequent amino acids to bind to and thus, be close enough Figure 6'13 TranSIation to each other for the formation of a peptide bond. The ribosome also acts as a catalyst (23S rRNA in bacteria is the enzyme- ribozyme) for the formation of peptide bond. A translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA that is ﬂanked by the start codon (AUG) and the stop codon and codes for a polypeptide. An mRNA also has some additional sequences that are not translated and are referred as untranslated regions (UTR). The UTRs are present at both 5'-end (before start codon) and at 3'-end (after stop codon). They are required for efficient translation process. For initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) that is recognised only by the initiator tRNA. The ribosome proceeds to the elongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes composed of an amino acid linked to tRNA, sequentially bind to the appropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with the tRNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into Polypeptide sequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA At the end, a release factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the complete polypeptide from the ribosome. 6.8 REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION Regulation of gene expression refers to a very broad term that may occur at various levels. Considering that gene expression results in the formation of a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels.

They are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in free space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we have studied so far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the Vibrations of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves of compression and rarefaction. Transverse elastic (sound) waves can also propagate in a solid, which is rigid and that resists shear. Scientists in the nineteenth century were so much used to this mechanical picture that they thought that there must be some medium pervading all space and all matter, which responds to electric and magnetic fields just as any elastic medium does. They called this medium ether. They were so convinced of the reality of this medium, that there is even a novel called The Poison Belt by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes) where the solar system is supposed to pass through a poisonous region of ether! We now accept that no such physical medium is needed. The famous experiment of Michelson and Morley in 1887 demolished conclusively the hypothesis of ether. Electric and magnetic fields, oscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in vacuum. But what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light, an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We have seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a medium are described in terms of a permittivity s and a magnetic permeability ,u (these describe the factors by which the total fields differ from the external fields). These replace so and [.10 in the description to electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in a material medium of permittivity e and magnetic permeability u, the velocity of light becomes, U = x/E (8.1 1) Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of the medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of one medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of light in the two media. The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an important fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the 2019-20",0

Use the same principle to deduce directly that a point object placed in front of a plane mirror produces a virtual image whose distance from the mirror is equal to the object distance from the mirror.

Here the electric ﬁeld is uniform and we are considering a closed cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total ﬂux ¢ through the surface is ¢ = $1 + $2 + ¢3, where ¢1 and $2 represent the ﬂux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the cylinder and $3 is the ﬂux through the curved cylindrical part of the closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is perpendicular to E, so by deﬁnition of ﬂux, $3 = 0. Further, the outward normal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E. Therefore, ¢1=_ES1’ ¢2=+E52 S1 = S2 = S where S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total ﬂux is zero, as expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric ﬂux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge contained in the closed surface is zero. The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let us note some important points regarding this law: (i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape or Size. (ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1 .31), includes the sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located anywhere inside the surface. (iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some charges inside and some outside, the electric ﬁeld [whose ﬂux appears on the left side of Eq. (1.3 1)] is due to all the charges, both inside and outside S. The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however, represents only the total charge inside S. 2019-20",0
607,833,"MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE disorders that affect human beings. Besides providing clues to understanding human biology, learning about non-human organisms DNA sequences can lead to an understanding of their natural capabilities that can be applied toward solving challenges in health care, agriculture, energy production, environmental remediation. Many non-human model organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans (a free living non-pathogenic nematode), Drosophila (the fruit ﬂy), plants (rice and Arabidopsis), etc., have also been sequenced. Methodologies : The methods involved two major approaches. One approach focused on identifying all the genes that are expressed as RNA (referred to as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The other took the blind approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that contained all the coding and non-coding sequence, and later assigning different regions in the sequence with functions (a term referred to as Sequence Annotation). For sequencing, the total DNA from a cell is isolated and converted into random fragments of relatively smaller sizes (recall DNA is a very long polymer, and there are technical limitations in sequencing very long pieces of DNA) and cloned in suitable host using specialised vectors. The cloning resulted into ampliﬁcation of each piece of DNA fragment so that it subsequently could be sequenced with ease. The commonly used hosts were bacteria and yeast, and the vectors were called as BAC (bacterial artiﬁcial chromosomes), and YAC (yeast artiﬁcial chromosomes) . The fragments were sequenced using automated DNA sequencers that worked on the principle of a method developed by Frederick Sanger. (Remember, Sanger is also credited for developing method for determination of amino acid sequences in proteins). These sequences were then arranged based on some overlapping regions present in them. This required generation of overlapping fragments for sequencing. Alignment of these sequences was humanly not possible. Therefore, specialised computer based programs were developed (Figure 6.1 5). These sequences were subsequently annotated and were assigned to each chromosome. The sequence of chromosome 1 was completed only in May 2006 (this was the last of the 24 human chromosomes — 22 Figure 6.15A representative diagram of human autosomes and X and Y — to be genome project 2019-2020",1

There is also another unit named “curie” that is widely used and is related to the 81 unit as: Marie Sklodowska Curie [1867-1934) Born in Poland. She is recognised both as a physicist and as a chemist. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired Marie and her husband Pierre Curie in their researches and analyses which led to the isolation of radium and polonium elements.

A common way to characterize this feature is through the notion of half-life. Half-life of a radionuclide (denoted by 71/2) is the time it takes for a sample that has initially, say NO radionuclei to reduce to NO/ 2. Putting N= N0/2 and t= T1/2in Eq. (13.14), we get _ ln2 _ 0.693 TU2 — 7 — ,1 (13.17) Clearly if N0 reduces to half its value in time T1/2’ R0 Will also reduce to half its value in the same time according to Eq. (13.16). Another related measure is the average or mean life T. This again can be obtained from Eq. (1 3.14). The number of nuclei which decay in the time interval tto t+ At is R(t)At (= woe—“An. Each of them has lived for time t. Thus the total life of all these nuclei would be thNoe‘7“t At. It is clear that some nuclei may live for a short time while others may live longer. Therefore to obtain the mean life, we have to sum (or integrate) this expression over all times from O to co , and divide by the total number N0 of nuclei at t= 0. Thus, AND I te-Mdt O T = —— = 1]- te‘ltdt NO 0 One can show by performing this integral that T = l /A We summarise these results with the following: _ ln2 T1/2—7 =Tln2 (13.18) Radioactive elements (e. g., tritium, plutonium) which are short-lived i.e., have half-lives much less than the age of the universe (~ 15 billion years) have obviously decayed long ago and are not found in nature.

The mechanical work he does may be estimated simply with the help of the work—energy theorem. Assume : (a) The major work done in walking is due to the acceleration and deceleration of the legs with each stride [See Fig. 6.20). [b] Neglect air resistance. [c] Neglect the small work done in lifting the legs against gravity. [d] Neglect the swinging of hands etc. as is common in walking. As we can see in Fig. 6.20, in each stride the leg is brought from rest to a speed, approximately equal to the speed of walking, and then brought to rest again. 4—1 stride -—> Fig. 6.20 An illustration of a single stride in walking. While the ﬁrst leg is maximally off the round, the second leg is on the ground and vice-versa The work done by one leg in each stride is ml [)3 by the work—energy theorem. Here ml is the mass of the leg. Note ml vg/Z energy is expended by one set of leg muscles to bring the foot from rest to speed v0 while an additional ml v3 /2 is expended by a complementary set of leg muscles to bring the foot to rest from speed v0. Hence work done by both legs in one stride is (study Fig. 6.20 carefully) WS=2ml mg [6.34) Assuming mass of the leg ml: 10 kg and slow running with a speed of 10 km in a hour which translates to approximately 3 m s‘l, we obtain WS 2 180 J / stride If we take a stride to be 2 m long, the person covers 1.5 strides per second at his speed of 3 m s‘l. Thus the power expended P=180 J x1.5 snide stride second = 270 W We must bear in mind that this is a lower estimate since several avenues of power loss [e.g. swinging of hands, air resistance etc.) have been ignored. The interesting point is that we did not worry about the forces involved. The forces, mainly friction and those exerted on the leg by the muscles of the rest of the body, are hard to estimate. Static friction does no work and we bypassed the impossible task of estimating the work done by the muscles by taking recourse to the work—energy theorem. We can also see the advantage of a wheel. The wheel permits smooth locomotion without the continual starting and stopping in mammalian locomotion. 2019-20",0

611,1034,"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION harbour is extremely high and strict protection of these hotspots could reduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent. In India, ecologically unique and biodiversity-rich regions are legally protected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries. India now has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife sanctuaries. India has also a history of religious and cultural traditions that emphasised protection of nature. In many cultures, tracts of forest were set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and given total protection. Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and J aintia Hills in Meghalaya, Aravalli Hills of Raj asthan, Western Ghat regions of Karnataka and Maharashtra and the Sarguj a, Chanda and Bastar areas of Madhya Pradesh. In Meghalaya, the sacred groves are the last refuges for a large number of rare and threatened plants. Ex situ Conservation— In this approach, threatened animals and plants are taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting where they can be protected and given special care. Zoological parks, botanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve this purpose. There are many animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be maintained in zoological parks. In recent years ex situ conservation has advanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures. Now gametes of threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for long periods using cryopreservation techniques, eggs can be fertilised in vitro, and plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods. Seeds of different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept for long periods in seed banks. Biodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is therefore a collective responsibility of all nations. The historic Convention on Biological Diversity (The Earth Summit’) held in Rio de J aneiro in 1 992, called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its beneﬁts. In a follow-up, the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002 in J ohannesburg, South Africa, 190 countries pledged their commitment to achieve by 20 10, a signiﬁcant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional and local levels.

Biodiversity refers to the sum total of diversity that exists at all levels of biological organisation. Of particular importance is the diversity at genetic, species and ecosystem levels and conservation efforts are aimed at protecting diversity at all these levels.

Before the advent of this theory of special relativity it was presumed that mass and energy were conserved separately in a reaction. However, Einstein showed that mass is another form of energy and one can convert mass-energy into other forms of energy, say kinetic energy and vice-versa. Einstein gave the famous mass-energy equivalence relation E = mc2 (13.6) Here the energy equivalent of mass m is related by the above equation and c is the velocity of light in vacuum and is approximately equal to 3X 108 m s‘l. Example 13.2 Calculate the energy equivalent of 1 g of substance. Solution Energy, E= 10“3 x (3 x 108)2J E= 10‘3x 9 x 1016: 9 x 1013.1 Thus, if one gram of matter is converted to energy, there is a release of enormous amount of energy. Experimental verification of the Einstein’s mass-energy relation has been achieved in the study of nuclear reactions amongst nucleons, nuclei, electrons and other more recently discovered particles. In a reaction the conservation law of energy states that the initial energy and the ﬁnal energy are equal provided the energy associated with mass is also included. This concept is important in understanding nuclear masses and the interaction of nuclei with one another. They form the subject matter of the next few sections. 13.4.2 Nuclear binding energy In Section 13.2 we have seen that the nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons.

The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings called the cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristae increase the surface area. The two membranes have their own specific enzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the form of ATP, hence they are called ‘power houses’ of the cell. The matrix also possesses single circular DNA molecule, a few RNA molecules, ribosomes (7 OS) and the components required for the synthesis of proteins. The mitochondria divide by fission. 8. 5.5 Plastids Plastids are found in all plant cells and in euglenoides. These are easily observed under the microscope as they are large. They bear some speciﬁc pigments, thus imparting specific colours to the plants. Based on the type of pigments plastids can be classified into chloroplasts, chromoplasts and leucoplasts. The chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments which are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. In the chromoplasts fat soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene, xanthophylls and others are present. This gives the part of the plant a yellow, orange or red colour.

(10.29) gets modiﬁed to 1.22/1 d . :— mm 2nsinﬂ (10.30) The product n sinB is called the numerical aperture and is sometimes marked on the objective. The resolving power of the microscope is given by the reciprocal of the minimum separation of two points seen as distinct. It can be seen from Eq. (10.30) that the resolving power can be increased by choosing a medium of higher refractive index. Usually an oil having a refractive index close to that of the objective glass is used. Such an arrangement is called an ‘oil immersion objective’. Notice that it is not possible to make sinB larger than unity. Thus, we see that the resolving power of a microscope is basically determined by the wavelength of the light used. There is a likelihood of confusion between resolution and magnification, and similarly between the role of a telescope and a microscope to deal with these parameters. A telescope produces images of far objects nearer to our eye. Therefore objects which are not resolved at far distance, can be resolved by looking at them through a telescope. A microscope, on the other hand, magnifies objects (which are near to us) and produces their larger image. We may be looking at two stars or two satellites of a far-away planet, or we may be looking at different regions of a living cell. In this context, it is good to remember that a telescope resolves whereas a microscope magnifies. 10.6.4 The validity of ray optics An aperture (i.e., slit or hole) of size a illuminated by a parallel beam sends diffracted light into an angle of approximately z A/ a. This is the angular size of the bright central maximum. In travelling a distance 2, the diffracted beam therefore acquires a width 21/ a due to diffraction. It is interesting to ask at what value of z the spreading due to diffraction becomes comparable to the size a of the aperture. We thus approximately equate z?» / a with a. This gives the distance beyond which divergence of the beam of width abecomes significant. Therefore, (10.29) a2 3:7 (10.31) We deﬁne a quantity zF called the Fresnel distance by the following equation zF : a2 / x1 Equation (10.3 1) shows that for distances much smaller than zF, the spreading due to diffraction is smaller compared to the size of the beam. It becomes comparable when the distance is approximately zF. For distances much greater than 2 , the spreading due to diffraction 2019-20 375",0

If you take a string of length 1 metre or 100 metre, keep it along the line. shift its position every time. the arithmetic of man-hours of labour and expenses on the project is not commensurate with the outcome. Moreover. errors are bound to occur in this enormous task. There is an interesting fact about this. France and Belgium share a common international boundary. whose length mentioned in the ofﬁcial documents of the two countries differs substantially! Go one step beyond and imagine the coastline where land meets sea. Roads and rivers have fairly mild bends as compared to a coastline. Even so. all documents, including our school books. contain information on the length of the coastline of Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh. or the common boundary between two states. etc. Railway tickets come with the distance between stations printed on them. We have ‘milestones‘ all along the roads indicating the distances to various towns. So, how is it done? One has to decide how much error one can tolerate and optimise cost-effectiveness. If you want smaller errors. it will involve high technology and high costs. Suﬁice it to say that it requires fairly advanced level of physics. mathematics, engineering and technology. It belongs to the areas of fractals. which has lately become popular in theoretical physics. Even then one doesn't know how much to rely on the figure that props up. as is clear from the story of France and Belgium. Incidentally. this story of the FrancevBelgium discrepancy appears on the ﬁrst page of an advanced Physics book on the subject of fractals and chaos! mass density is obtained by deviding mass by the volume of the substance. If we have errors in the measurement of mass and of the sizes or dimensions, we must know what the error will be in the density of the substance. To make such estimates, we should learn how errors combine in various mathematical operations. For this, we use the following procedure. 2019-20 (a) Error of a sum or a difference Suppose two physical quantities A and B have measured values A i AA, B i AB respectively where AA and AB are their absolute errors. We wish to find the error AZ in the sum Z = A + B. We have by addition, Z i AZ = (AiAA) + (BiAB). The maximum possible error in Z AZ 2 AA + AB For the difference Z = A — B, we have ZiAZ= (AiAA)—(BiAB) =(A—B)iAAiAB or, i AZ = i AA i AB The maximum value of the error AZ is again AA + AB. Hence the rule : When two quantities are added or subtracted, the absolute error in the ﬁnal result is the sum of the absolute errors in the individual quantities. Example 2.8 The temperatures of two bodies measured by a thennometer are t1: 20 0C i 0.5 0C and t2 = 50 0C i 0.5 0C. Calculate the temperature difference and the error theirin. Answer t’ = t2—t1 = (50 0C105 0C)— (200Ci0.5 0C) t’ = 30 0C i l 0C { (b) Error of a product or a quotient Suppose Z = AB and the measured values of A and B are A 1 AA and B i AB. Then ZiAZ= (AiAA) (BiAB) =ABi BAAiAABiAAAB. Dividing LHS by Z and RHS by AB we have, li(AZ/ZJ = l i (AA/A) i (AB/B) i (AA/A)(AB/B). Since AA and AB are small, we shall ignore their product. Hence the maximum relative error AZ/ Z= (AA/A) + (AB/B). You can easily verify that this is true for division also. Hence the rule : When two quantities are multiplied or divided, the relative error in the result is the sum of the relative errors in the multipliers.",0

Some plants such as Viola (common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina produce two types of flowers — chasmogamous ﬂowers which are similar to ﬂowers of other species with exposed anthers and stigma, and Cleistogamous ﬂowers which do not open at all (Figure 2.9c). In such ﬂowers, the anthers and stigma lie close to each other. When anthers dehisce in the ﬂower buds, pollen grains come in contact with the stigma to effect pollination. Thus, Cleistogamous ﬂowers are invariably autogamous as there is no chance of cross-pollen landing on the stigma. Cleistogamous ﬂowers produce assured seed-set even in the absence of pollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is advantageous or disadvantageous to the plant? Why? Geitonogamy- Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of another ﬂower of the same plant. Although geitonogamy is functionally cross-pollination involving a pollinating agent, genetically it is similar to autogamy since the pollen grains come from the same plant. Xenogamy - Transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure 2.9b). This is the only type of pollination which during pollination brings genetically different types of pollen grains to the stigma. Agents of Pollination : Plants use two abiotic (wind and water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve pollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for pollination. Only a small proportion of plants use abiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with the stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water pollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and associated loss of pollen grains, the ﬂowers produce enormous amount of pollen when compared to the number of ovules available for pollination. 20192020",1

The position of P’ on the x—aXis, as the particle P moves on the circle, is given by x(t) = A cos (wt+ ¢) which is the defining equation of SHM. This shows that if P moves uniformly on a circle, its projection P’ on a diameter of the circle executes SHM. The particle P and the circle on which it moves are sometimes referred to as the reference particle and the reference circle, respectively. We can take projection of the motion of P on any diameter, say the y-axis. In that case. the displacement y(t) of P’ on the y-axis is given by y=Asin (cot+ (1)) which is also an SHM of the same amplitude as that of the projection on x-axis, but differing by a phase of 7r/2. In spite of this connection between circular motion and SHM, the force acting on a particle in linear simple harmonic motion is very different from the centripetal force needed to keep a particle in uniform circular motion. 347 Example 14.4 The figure given below depicts two circular motions. The radius of the circle. the period of revolution. the initial position and the sense of revolution are indicated in the figures. Obtain the simple harmonic motions of the x-projection of the radius vector of the rotating particle P in each case. Answer (a) At t= 0, OP makes an angle of 450 = 7c/4 rad with the (positive direction of) x—axis. After time t, it covers an angle 272% in the anticlockwise sense, and makes an angle of ﬁt + E with the x-aXis.

Angle is a dimensionless quantity. Therefore it is not always necessary to mention the unit ‘radian’ when we use 7:, its multiples or submultiples. The conversion between radian and degree is not similar to that between metre and centimetre or mile. If the argument of a trigonometric function is stated without units, it is understood that the unit is radian. On the other hand, if degree is to be used as the unit of angle, then it must be shown explicitly. For example, sin(1 50) means sine of 1 5 degree, but sin(1 5) means sine of 1 5 radians. Hereafter, we will often drop ‘rad’ as the unit, and it should be understood that whenever angle is mentioned as a numerical value, without units, it is to be taken as radians. 2019-20",0

As such it is a vital skill for farmers and is as much science as it is art. Animal husbandry deals with the care and breeding of livestock like buffaloes, cows, pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, camels, goats, etc., that are useful to humans. Extended, it includes poultry farming and ﬁsheries. Fisheries include rearing, catching, selling, etc., of fish, molluscs (shell-ﬁsh) and crustaceans (prawns, crabs, etc.). Since time immemorial, animals like bees, silk-worm, prawns, crabs, ﬁshes, birds, pigs, cattle, sheep and camels have been used by humans for products like milk, eggs, meat, wool, silk, honey, etc. It is estimated that more then 7 0 per cent of the world livestock population is in India and China.

622,1749,"4 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements 1 .3.1 Categories of Share Capital From accounting point of View the share capital of the company can be classified as follows: Authorised Capital: Authorised capital is the amount of share capital which a company is authorised to issue by its Memorandum of Association. The company cannot raise more than the amount of capital as speciﬁed in the Memorandum of Association. It is also called Nominal or Registered capital. The authorised capital can be increased or decreased as per the procedure laid down in the Companies Act. It should be noted that the company need not issue the entire authorised capital for public subscription at a time. Depending upon its requirement, it may issue share capital but in any case, it should not be more than the amount of authorised capital. Issued Capital: It is that part of the authorised capital which is actually issued to the public for subscription including the shares allotted to vendors and the signatories to the company's memorandum. The authorised capital which is not offered for public subscription is known as ‘unissued capital'. Unissued capital may be offered for public subscription at a later date. Subscribed Capital: It is that part of the issued capital which has been actually subscribed by the public. When the shares offered for public subscription are subscribed fully by the public the issued capital and subscribed capital would be the same. It may be noted that ultimately, the subscribed capital and issued capital are the same because if the number of share, subscribed is less than what is offered, the company allot only the number of shares for which subscription has been received. In case it is higher than what is offered, the allotment will be equal to the offer. In other words, the fact of over subscription is not reﬂected in the books. Called up Capital: It is that part of the subscribed capital which has been called up on the shares. The company may decide to call the entire amount or part of the face value of the shares. For example, if the face value (also called nominal value) of a share allotted is Rs. 10 and the company has called up only Rs. 7 per share, in that scenario, the called up capital is Rs. 7 per share. The remaining Rs. 3 may be collected from its shareholders as and when needed. Paid up Capital: It is that portion of the called up capital which has been actually received from the shareholders. When the shareholders have paid all the call amount, the called up capital is the same to the paid up capital. If any of the shareholders has not paid amount on calls, such an amount may be called as ‘calls in arrears'. Therefore, paid up capital is equal to the called-up capital minus call in arrears. Uncalled Capital: That portion of the subscribed capital which has not yet been called up. As stated earlier, the company may collect this amount any time when it needs further funds.",3

The Nitrogen Cycle Nitrogen is a major constituent of the atmosphere comprising about seventy-eight per cent of the atmospheric gases. It is also an essential constituent of different organic compounds such as the amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins, vitamins and pigments. Only a few types of organisms like certain species of soil bacteria and blue green algae are capable of utilising it directly in its gaseous form. Generally, nitrogen is usable only after it is fixed. Ninety per cent of fixed nitrogen is biological. The principal source of free nitrogen is the action of soil micro-organisms and associated plant roots on atmospheric nitrogen found in pore spaces of the soil. Nitrogen can also be fixed in the atmosphere by lightning and cosmic radiation. In the oceans, some marine animals can fix it. After atmospheric nitrogen has been ﬁxed into an available form, green plants can assimilate it. Herbivorous animals feeding on plants, in turn, consume some of it. Dead plants and animals, excretion of nitrogenous wastes are converted into nitrites by the action of bacteria present in the soil. Some bacteria can even convert nitrites into nitrates that can be used again by green plants. There are still other types of bacteria capable of converting nitrates into free nitrogen, a process known as denitriﬁcation (Figure l 5.3). l Atmospheric Nitrogen I l (M “ Atmospheric ‘ Biological , Industrial I Fixation J Fixation ""l Fixation [ Compounds w! Dentriﬁcation Figure 15.3 : Nitrogen Cycle FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Other Mineral Cycles Other than carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen being the principal geochemical components of the biosphere, many other minerals also occur as critical nutrients for plant and animal life. These mineral elements required by living organisms are obtained initially from inorganic sources such as phosphorus, sulphur, calcium and potassium. They usually occur as salts dissolved in soil water or lakes, streams and seas. Mineral salts come directly from the earth’s crust by weathering where the soluble salts enter the water cycle, eventually reaching the sea. Other salts are returned to the earth’s surface through sedimentation, and after weathering, they again enter the cycle. All living organisms fulﬁll their mineral requirements from mineral solutions in their environments. Other animals receive their mineral needs from the plants and animals they consume. After the death of living organisms, the minerals are returned to the soil and water through decomposition and ﬂow. Ecological Balance Ecological balance is a state of dynamic equilibrium within a community of organisms in a habitat or ecosystem. It can happen when the diversity of the living organisms remains relatively stable. Gradual changes do take place but that happens only through natural succession. It can also be explained as a stable balance in the numbers of each species in an ecosystem. This occurs through competition and cooperation between different organisms where population remains stable. This balance is brought about by the fact that certain species compete with one another determined by the environment in which they grow. This balance is also attained by the fact that some species depend on others for their food and sustenance. Such accounts are encountered in vast grasslands where the herbivorous animals (deer, zebras, buffaloes, etc.) are found in plenty. On the other hand, the carnivorous animals (tigers, lions, etc.) that are not usually in large numbers, hunt and feed on the herbivores, thereby controlling their population. In the plants, any disturbance in the native forests such as clearing the forest for shifting cultivation usually brings about a 2019-2020",2

627,1683,"Issue and Redemption of Debentures 73 Bond: Bond is also an instrument of acknowledgement of debt. Traditionally, the Government issued bonds, but these days, bonds are also being issued by semi—government and non—governmental organisations. The terms ‘debentures' and ‘Bonds' are now being used inter-changeably. 2.2 Distinction between Shares and Debentures Ownership: A ‘share' represents ownership of the company whereas a debenture is only acknowledgement of Debt. A share is a part of the owned capital whereas a debenture is a part of borrowed capital. Return: The return on shares is known as dividend while the return on debentures is called interest. The rate of return on shares may vary from year to year depending upon the proﬁts of the company but the rate of interest on debentures is prefixed. The payment of dividend is an appropriation of proﬁts, whereas the payment of interest is a charge on proﬁts and is to be paid even if there is no proﬁt. Repayment: Normally, the amount of shares is not returned during the life of the company, whereas, generally, the debentures are issued for a speciﬁed period and repayable on the expiry of that period. However, in the year 1998, the amendements (Section 77A and 77 B sub Section 2) in the Companies Act, permitted companies to buy back its shares specially when market value of shares are less than its book value. Voting Rights: Shareholders enjoy voting rights whereas debentureholders do not normally enjoy any voting right. Security : Shares are not secured by any charge whereas the debentures are generally secured and carry a ﬁxed or ﬂoating charge over the assets of the company. Convertibility: Shares cannot be converted into debentures whereas debentures can be converted into shares if the terms of issue so provide, and in that case these are known as convertible debentures. 2.3 Types of Debentures A company may issue different kinds of debentures which can be classified as under:",3
628,465,"10 i Physics EXAMPLE 1 . 2 EXAMPLE 1 .3 quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale involved that is very important. Example 1.2 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of l C on the other body? Solution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore the charge given out in one second is 1.6 X 10’19 X 109C = 1.6 X 10‘10 C. The time required to accumulate a charge of l C can then be estimated to be 1 c + (1.6 x 10—10 C/s) = 6.25 x 109 s = 6.25 x 109+ (365 x 24 x 3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb, from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large unit for many practical purposes. It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material. A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 X 1024 electrons. Example 1.3 How much positive and negative charge is there in a cup of water? Solution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is 250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole (= 6.02 X 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of molecules in one cup of water is (250/ 18) X 6.02 X 1023. Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to (250/18) x 6.02 x 1023 x 10 x 1.6 x 10‘19 c = 1.34 x 107 c. 1 .6 COULOMB’s LAW Coulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the charged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as the square of the distance between the charges and was directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and acted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the force (F) between them is given by lqlrzqgl (1.1) How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb used a torsion balance* for measuring the force between two charged metallic F=k * A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later by Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two obj ects, to verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation. 2019-20",0
629,836,"BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES of CO2 from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place, i.e., CO2 which is bound to haemoglobin from the tissues is delivered at the alveoli. RBCs contain a very high concentration of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase and minute quantities of the same is present in the plasma too. This enzyme facilitates the following reaction in both directions. At the tissue site where partial pressure of CO2 is high due to catabolism, CO2 diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO; and H’“. At the alveolar site where pCO2 is low, the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction leading to the formation of CO2 and H20. Thus, CO2 trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to the alveoli is released out as CO2 (Figure 17 .4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenated blood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO2 to the alveoli. 17.5 REGULATION OF RESPIRATION Human beings have a signiﬁcant ability to maintain and moderate the respiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is done by the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla region of the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for this regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the brain called pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory rhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of inspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area is situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO2 and hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre, which in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments in the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated. Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise changes in CO2 and H’“ concentration and send necessary signals to the rhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of respiratory rhythm is quite insigniﬁcant. 17.6 DISORDERS 0F RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Asthma is a difﬁculty in breathing causing wheezing due to inﬂammation of bronchi and bronchioles. Emphysema is a chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damaged due to which respiratory surface is decreased. One of the major causes of this is cigarette smoking.",1

Stopping distance is an important factor considered in setting speed limits, for example, in school zones. 4 F Example 3.8 Reaction time : When a situation demands our immediate action, it takes some time before we really respond. Reaction time is the time a person takes to observe, think and act. For example. if a person is driving and suddenly a boy appears on the road. then the time elapsed before he slams the brakes of the car is the reaction time. Reaction time depends on complexity of the situation and on an individual. You can measure your reaction time by a simple experiment.

While that train must be travelling faster than you to be able to pass you, it does seem slower to you than it would be to someone standing on the ground and watching both the trains. In case both the trains have the same velocity with respect to the ground, then to you the other train would seem to be not moving at all. To understand such observations, we now introduce the concept of relative velocity. Consider two objects A and B moving uniformly with average velocities vA and DB in one dimension, say along x-axis. (Unless otherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in this chapter are measured with reference to the ground). Ifo (0) and xB (O) are positions of objects A and B, respectively at time t = 0, their positions xA (t) and xB (t) at time tare given by: xA (t) xA(O) + vA t (3.12a) xB (t) xB(O) + vBt (3.12b) Then, the displacement from object A to object B is given by xBA(t) = x8 (t) — xA (t) =1x,,(0)— x,(0)1+(uB— DA) t. (3.13) Equation (3.13) is easily interpreted. It tells us that as seen from object A, object B has a velocity vB— vA because the displacement from A to B changes steadily by the amount vB— DA in each unit of time. We say that the velocity of object B relative to objectA is vB — vA : — vA (3.14a) vBA = DB Similarly, velocity of object A relative to object B is: v = vA—vB (3.14b) AB 2019-20",0

In yeast, the division is unequal and small buds are produced that remain attached initially to the parent cell which, eventually gets separated and mature into new yeast organisms (cells). Under unfavourable condition the Amoeba withdraws its pseudopodia and secretes a three-layered hard covering or cyst around itself. This phenomenon is termed as encystation. When favourable conditions return, the encysted Amoeba divides by multiple fission and produces many minute amoeba or pseudopodiospores; the cyst wall bursts out, and the spores are liberated in the surrounding medium to grow up into many amoebae.

The potential difference Evacuated between the emitter and collector plates is measured by glass tube . a voltmeter (V) whereas the resulting photo current ﬂowing in the circuit is measured by a microammeter (HA). The photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the potential of collector plate A with respect to the emitter plate C. The intensity and v / Commutator frequency of the incident light can be varied, as can the potential difference V between the emitter C and the collector A.

We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and measure the resulting photocurrent each time. It is found that the photoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating) potential. At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the emitted electrons are collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current becomes maximum or saturates. If we increase the accelerating potential of plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase. This maximum value of the photoelectric current is called saturation current. Saturation current corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by the emitter plate C reach the collector plate A. We now apply a negative (retarding) potential to the plate A with respect to the plate C and make it increasingly negative gradually. When the 2019-20",0
638,1284,"36 BIOLOGY organs are produced either on the same or on different thalli. The sporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis, spores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to form free-living gametophytes. 3.2.2 Mosses The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The ﬁrst stage is the protonema stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently ﬁlamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs. Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal. Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum (Figure 3.2). 3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the ﬁrst terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues — xylem and phloem. You shall study more about these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp, shady places though some may ﬂourish well in sandy-soil conditions. You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,",1

640,768,"l Physics (ii) Diamond: Diamonds are known for their spectacular brilliance. Their brilliance is mainly due to the total internal reﬂection of light inside them. The critical angle for diamond-air interface (E 24.4°) is very small, therefore once light enters a diamond, it is very likely to undergo total internal reﬂection inside it. Diamonds found in nature rarely exhibit the brilliance for which they are known. It is the technical skill of a diamond cutter which makes diamonds to sparkle so brilliantly. By cutting the diamond suitably, multiple total internal reflections can be made to occur. (iii) Prism: Prisms designed to bend light by FIGURE 9.15 Prisms designed to bend rays by 90° or by 180° make use oftotal internal 90° and 180° or to invert image without changing reﬂection [Fig 915(3) and (b)] Such a its size make. use of total internal reﬂection. prism is also used to invert images without changing their size [Fig 9. 15(0)]. In the first two cases, the critical angle is for the material of the prism must be less than 45°. We see from Table 9.1 that this is true for both crown glass and dense ﬂint glass. (iv) Optical ﬁbres: Nowadays optical fibres are extensively used for transmitting audio and video signals through long distances. Optical ﬁbres too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reﬂection. Optical ﬁbres are fabricated with high quality composite glass / quartz ﬁbres. Each fibre consists of a core and cladding. The refractive index of the material of the core is higher than that of the cladding. When a signal in the form of light is Low n directed at one end of the fibre at a suitable \ angle, it undergoes repeated total internal reﬂections along the length of the fibre and finally comes out at the other end (Fig. 9.16). Since light undergoes total internal reﬂection High n at each stage, there is no appreciable loss in the intensity of the light signal. Optical fibres FIGURE 9. 16 Light undergoes successive total are fabricated such that light reﬂected at one internal reﬂections as it moves through an side Of inner surface strikes the other at an Optlcal hbre' angle larger than the critical angle. Even if the fibre is bent, light can easily travel along its length. Thus, an optical fibre can be used to act as an optical pipe. A bundle of optical fibres can be put to several uses. Optical fibres are extensively used for transmitting and receiving electrical signals which are converted to light by suitable transducers. Obviously, optical fibres can also be used for transmission of optical signals. For example, these are used as a ‘light pipe’ to facilitate visual examination of internal organs 322 like esophagus, stomach and intestines. You might have seen a commonly 2019-20",0
641,1299,"BIOIDGICAL CLASSIFICATION Viroids : In 197 1, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent that was smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It was found to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses, hence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight. Prions : In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases were found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded protein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called prions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) commonly called mad cow disease in cattle and its analogous variant Cr—Jacob disease (CJD) in humans. Lichens : Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful associations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as phycobiont and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophic and heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi provide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner. So close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would never imagine that they had two different organisms within them. Lichens are very good pollution indicators — they do not grow in polluted areas. SUMMARY Biological classiﬁcation of plants and animals was ﬁrst proposed by Aristotle on the basis of simple morphological characters. Linnaeus later classiﬁed all living organisms into two kingdoms — Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an elaborate ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation — Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The main criteria of the ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation were cell structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships. In the ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera. Bacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of nutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as Chrysophytes, Dinoﬂagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists have deﬁned nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce both asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity in structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition. They show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom. The plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in this group. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations — gametophytic and sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellular organisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode of nutrition of these organisms is holozoic. They reproduce mostly by the sexual mode. Some acellular organisms like viruses and viroids as well as the lichens are not included in the ﬁve kingdom system of classiﬁcation. 27",1

Inducing mutations in plants through diverse means and then screening the plant materials for resistance sometimes leads to desirable genes being identiﬁed. Plants having these desirable characters can then be either multiplied directly or can be used in breeding. Other breeding methods that are used are selection amongst somaclonal variants and genetic engineering. Mutation is the process by which genetic variations are created through changes in the base sequence within genes (see Chapter 5) resulting in the creation of a new character or trait not found in the parental type. It is possible to induce mutations artiﬁcially through use of chemicals or radiations (like gamma radiations), and selecting and using the plants that have the desirable character as a source in breeding — this process is called mutation breeding. In mung bean, resistance to yellow mosaic virus and powdery mildew were induced by mutations. Several wild relatives of different cultivated species of plants have been shown to have certain resistant characters but have very low yield. Hence, there is a need to introduce the resistant genes into the high-yielding cultivated varieties. Resistance to yellow mosaic Virus in bhindi (Abelmoschus esculentus) was transferred from a wild species and resulted in a new variety of A. esculentus called Parbhani kranti. 2019-2020",1

The biogas plant has an outlet, which is connected to a pipe to supply biogas to nearby houses. The spent slurry is removed through another outlet and may be used as fertiliser. Cattle dung is available in large quantities in rural areas where cattle are used for a variety of purposes. So biogas plants are more often built in rural areas. The biogas thus produced is used for cooking and lighting. The picture of a biogas plant is shown in Figure 10.8. The Figure 10.8 A typical biOgaS Plant technologl of biogas production was developed in India mainly due to the efforts of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC).

Gas-holder Sludge Digester 10.5 MICROBES AS BIOCONTROL AGENTS Biocontrol refers to the use of biological methods for controlling plant diseases and pests. In modern society, these problems have been tackled increasingly by the use of chemicals — by use of insecticides and pesticides. These chemicals are toxic and extremely harmful, to human beings and animals alike, and have been polluting our environment (soil, ground water), fruits, vegetables and crop plants. Our soil is also polluted through our use of weedicides to remove weeds. Biological control of pests and diseases: In agriculture, there is a method of controlling pests that relies on natural predation rather than introduced chemicals. A key belief of the organic farmer is that biodiversity furthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable it is. The organic farmer, therefore, works to create a system where the insects that are sometimes called pests are not eradicated, but instead are kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances within a living and vibrant ecosystem.

Communication TRANSPORT Transport is a service or facility for the carriage of persons and goods from one place to the other using humans, animals and different kinds of vehicles. Such movements take place over land, water and air. Roads and railways form part of land transport; while shipping and waterways and airways are the other two modes. Pipelines carry materials like petroleum, natural gas, and ores in liquidified form. Moreover, transportation is an organised service industry created to satisfy the basic needs of society. It includes transport arteries, vehicles to carry people and goods, and the organisation to maintain arteries, and to handle loading, unloading and delivery.

646,794,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION 10.1. 1 Phases of Cell Cycle A typical eukaryotic cell cycle is illustrated by human cells in culture. These cells divide once in approximately every 24 hours (Figure 10.1). However, this duration of cell cycle can vary from organism to organism and also from cell type to cell type. Yeast for example, can progress through the cell cycle in only about 90 minutes. The cell cycle is divided into two basic phases: 0 Interphase o M Phase (Mitosis phase) The M Phase represents the phase when the actual cell division or mitosis occurs and the interphase represents the phase between two successive M phases. It is significant to note that in the 24 hour average duration of cell cycle of a human cell, cell division proper lasts for only about an hour. The interphase lasts more than 95% of the duration of cell cycle. 163 M Phase Metapham‘. Figure 10.1 A diagrammatic view of cell cycle indicating formation of two cells from one cell The M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends with division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The interphase, though called the resting phase, is the time during which the cell is preparing for division by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner. The interphase is divided into three further phases: 0 G1 phase (Gap 1) o S phase (Synthesis) 0 G2 phase (Gap 2) G1 phase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication. During G1 phase the cell is metabolically active and continuously grows but does not replicate its DNA. S or synthesis phase marks the period during which DNA synthesis or replication takes place. During this time the amount of DNA per cell doubles. If the initial amount of DNA is denoted as 2C then it increases to 4C. However, there is no increase in the chromosome number; if the cell had diploid or 2n number of chromosomes at G1, even after S phase the number of chromosomes remains the same, i.e., 2n. In animal cells, during the S phase, DNA replication begins in the nucleus, and the centriole duplicates in the cytoplasm. During the G2 phase, proteins are synthesised in preparation for mitosis while cell growth continues. How do plants and animals continue to grow all their lives? Do all cells in a plant divide all the time? Do you think all cells continue to divide in all plants and animals? Can you tell the name and the location of tissues having cells that divide all their life in higher plants? Do animals have similar meristematic tissues? 2019-2020",1

Nitrogenase NEN NHS The nitrogen-ﬁxing microbes could be free-living or symbiotic. Examples of free-living nitrogen-ﬁxing aerobic microbes are Azotobacter and Beyerinckia while Rhodospirillum is anaerobic and free-living. In addition, a number of cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc are also free- living nitrogen-fixers. Symbiotic biological nitrogen ﬁxation Several types of symbiotic biological nitrogen ﬁxing associations are known. The most prominent among them is the legume-bacteria relationship. Species of rod-shaped Rhizobium has such relationship with the roots of several legumes such as alfalfa, sweet clover, sweet pea, lentils, garden pea, broad bean, clover beans, etc. The most common association on roots is as nodules. These nodules are small outgrowths on the roots. The microbe, Frankia, also produces nitrogen-ﬁxing nodules on the roots of non- leguminous plants (e.g., Alnus). Both Rhizobium and Frankia are free- living in soil, but as symbionts, can ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen. Uproot any one plant of a common pulse, just before ﬂowering. You will see near-spherical outgrowths on the roots. These are nodules. If you cut through them you will notice that the central portion is red or pink. What makes the nodules pink? This is due to the presence of leguminous haemoglobin or leg-haemoglobin. Nodule Formation Nodule formation involves a sequence of multiple interactions between Rhizobium and roots of the host plant. Principal stages in the nodule formation are summarised as follows: Rhizobia multiply and colonise the surroundings of roots and get attached to epidermal and root hair cells. The root-hairs curl and the bacteria invade the root-hair. An infection thread is produced carrying the bacteria into the cortex of the root, where they initiate the nodule formation in the cortex of the root. Then the bacteria are released from the thread into the cells which leads to the differentiation of specialised nitrogen ﬁxing cells. The nodule thus formed, establishes a direct vascular connection with the host for exchange of nutrients. These events are depicted in Figure 12.4. The nodule contains all the necessary biochemical components, such as the enzyme nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin. The enzyme nitrogenase is a Mo-Fe protein and catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, (Figure 12.5) the ﬁrst stable product of nitrogen ﬁxation.",1

The morphological features of stems like the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Stems also get modiﬁed to perform diverse functions such as storage of food, vegetative propagation and protection under different conditions. Leaf is a lateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are green in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit marked variations in their shape, size, margin, apex and extegtyof incisions of leafg‘lade (lamina).

653,928,"236 (iv) BIOLOGY vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts. Majority of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its population density. They might render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it physically weak. Do you believe that an ideal parasite should be able to thrive within the host without harming it? Then why didn’t natural selection lead to the evolution of such totally harmless parasites? Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites. The most familiar examples of this group are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine ﬁsh are infested with ectoparasitic copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant that is commonly found growing on hedge plants, has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution. It derives its nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises. The female mosquito is not considered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction. Can you explain why? In contrast, endoparasites are those that live inside the host body at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.). The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their extreme specialisation. Their morphological and anatomical features are greatly simpliﬁed while emphasising their reproductive potential. Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them. During the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host’s egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host bird detecting the foreign eggs and ejecting them from the nest. Try to follow the movements of the cuckoo (koel) and the crow in your neighborhood park during the breeding season (spring to summer) and watch brood parasitism in action. Commensalism: This is the interaction in which one species beneﬁts and the other is neither harmed nor beneﬁted. An orchid growing as an epiphyte on a mango branch, and barnacles growing on the back of a whale beneﬁt while neither the mango tree nor the whale derives any apparent beneﬁt. The cattle egret and grazing cattle in close association, a sight you are most likely to catch if you live in farmed rural areas, is a classic example of commensalism. The egrets always forage close to where the cattle are grazing because the cattle, as they move, stir up and ﬂush out insects from the vegetation that otherwise might be difﬁcult for the egrets to ﬁnd and catch. Another example of commensalism is the interaction 2019—2020",1

It consists of a tube with a broad diameter and a small constriction at the middle as shown in Fig. (10.11). A manometer in the form of a U-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at the broad neck point of the tube and the other at constriction as shown in Fig. (10.11). The manometer contains a liquid of density pm. The speed v1 of the liquid ﬂowing through the tube at the broad neck area A is to be measured from equation of continuity Eq.

658,727,"i Physics 1.5 BASIC PROPERTIES OF ELECTRIC CHARGE We have seen that there are two types of charges, namely positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each other. Here, we shall now describe some other properties of the electric charge. If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the distances between them, we treat them as point charges. All the charge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point in space. 1.5.1 Additivity of charges We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall follow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q1 and q2, the total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1, q2, q3, qn, then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + (13 + + qn. Charge has magnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However, there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, —3, +4 and —5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+ 1) + (+2) + [—3) + (+4) + [—5) = —l in the same unit. 1.5.2 Charge is conserved We have already hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses. Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is found that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved. Conservation of charge has been established experimentally. It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after the creation. 1.5.3 Quantisation of charge Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples of a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always given by q=ne 2019-20",0

The shape of the uterus is like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic wall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of the cervix is called cervical canal (Figure 3.3b) which alongwith vagina forms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue. The external thin membranous perimetrium, middle thick layer of smooth muscle, myometrium and inner glandular layer called endometrium that lines the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during menstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during delivery of the baby. The female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and clitoris (Figure 3.3a). Mons pubis is a cushion of fatty tissue covered by skin and pubic hair. The labia majora are ﬂeshy folds of tissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal opening. The labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora. The opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called hymen. The clitoris is a tiny ﬁnger-er structure which lies at the upper junction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening. The hymen is often torn during the ﬁrst coitus (intercourse). However, it can also be broken by a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, active participation in some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc. In some women the hymen persists even aﬁer coitus. In fact, the presence or absence of hymen is not a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience.

Now a question that arises in our minds is: Are all living organisms made of the same chemicals, i.e., elements and compounds? You have learnt in chemistry how elemental analysis is performed. If we perform such an analysis on a plant tissue, animal tissue or a microbial paste, we obtain a list of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and several others and their respective content per unit mass of a living tissue. If the same analysis is performed on a piece of earth’s crust as an example of non-living matter, we obtain a similar list. What are the differences between the two lists? In absolute terms, no such differences could be made out. All the elements present in a sample of earth’s crust are also present in a sample of living tissue. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance of carbon and hydrogen with respect to other elements is higher in any living organism than in earth’s crust (Table 9.1). 9.1 How TO ANALYSE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION? We can continue asking in the same way, what type of organic compounds are found in living organisms? How does one go about finding the answer? To get an answer, one has to perform a chemical analysis. We can take any living tissue (a vegetable or a piece of liver, etc.) and grind it in trichloroacetic acid (C13CCOOH) using a mortar and a pestle. We obtain a thick slurry. If we were to strain this through a cheesecloth or cotton we would Obtain two fractions.

This was soon followed by a series of Cockroft—Walton type of accelerators established in Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Aligarh, Bose Institute, Kolkata and Andhra University, Waltair. The sixties saw the commissioning of a number of Van de Graaff accelerators: a 5.5 MV terminal machine in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai (1963); a 2 MV terminal machine in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur; a 400 kV terminal machine in Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi; and Punjabi University, Patiala.

663,361,"Nuclei The composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily explained. The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same number of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons. Deuterium, 2H, which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton and one neutron. Its other isotope tritium, 3H , contains one proton and two neutrons. The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from A = 1 73 to A = 204. We have already mentioned that chemical properties of elements depend on their electronic structure. As the atoms of isotopes have identical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and are placed in the same location in the periodic table. All nuclides with same mass number A are called isobars. For example, the nuclides f’H and 3He are isobars. Nuclides with same neutron number N but different atomic number Z, for example 1;? Hg and 1397 Au, are called isotones. 13.3 SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS As we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who postulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus. At Rutherford’s suggestion, Geiger and Marsden performed their classic experiment: on the scattering of a-particles from thin gold foils. Their experiments revealed that the distance of closest approach to a gold nucleus of an a-particle of kinetic energy 5.5 MeV is about 4.0 X 10‘14 m. The scattering of a-particle by the gold sheet could be understood by Rutherford by assuming that the coulomb repulsive force was solely responsible for scattering. Since the positive charge is confined to the nucleus, the actual size of the nucleus has to be less than 4.0 X 10—14m. If we use a—particles of higher energies than 5.5 MeV, the distance of closest approach to the gold nucleus will be smaller and at some point the scattering will begin to be affected by the short range nuclear forces, and differ from Rutherford’s calculations. Rutherford’s calculations are based on pure coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the a- particle and the gold nucleus. From the distance at which deviations set in, nuclear sizes can be inferred. By performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead of OL-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various elements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately measured. It has been found that a nucleus of mass number A has a radius R =R0A1/3 (13.5) where R0 = 1.2 X 10‘15m (=1.2 fm; 1 frn = 10—15m). This means the volume of the nucleus, which is proportional to R3 is proportional to A. Thus the density of nucleus is a constant, independent of A, for all nuclei. Different nuclei are like a drop of liquid of constant density. The density of nuclear matter is approximately 2.3 X 1017 kg m‘3. This density is very large compared to ordinary matter, say water, which is 103 kg m‘3. This is understandable, as we have already seen that most of the atom is empty. Ordinary matter consisting of atoms has a large amount of empty space. 2019-20 441",0

There are ten pairs of cranial nerves arising from the brain. Brain is enclosed in a bony structure called brain box (cranium). The brain is divided into fore-brain, mid-brain and hind-brain. Forebrain includes olfactory lobes, paired cerebral hemispheres and unpaired diencephalon. The midbrain is characterised by a pair of optic lobes. Hind-brain consists of cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The medulla oblongata passes out through the foramen magnum and continues into spinal cord, which is enclosed in the vertebral column. Frog has different types of sense organs, namely organs of touch (sensory papillae), taste (taste buds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) and hearing (tympanum with internal ears). Out of these, eyes and internal ears are well-organised structures and the rest are cellular aggregations around nerve endings. Eyes in a frog are a pair of spherical structures situated in the orbit in skull. These are simple eyes (possessing only one unit). External ear is absent in frogs and only tympanum can be seen externally. The ear is an organ of hearing as well as balancing (equilibrium). Frogs have well organised male and female reproductive systems. Male reproductive organs consist of a pair of yellowish ovoid testes (Figure 7.2 1), which are found adhered to the upper part of kidneys by a double fold of peritoneum called mesorchium. Vasa efferentia are 1 0- 1 2 in number that arise from testes. They enter the kidneys on their side and open into Bidder’s canal. Finally it communicates with the urinogenital duct that comes out of the kidneys and opens into the cloaca. The cloaca is a small, median chamber that is used to pass faecal matter, urine and sperms to the exterior. The female reproductive organs include a pair of ovaries (Figure 7.22). The ovaries are situated near kidneys and there is no functional connection with kidneys.

665,313,"l Physics APPENDIX 11.1 The history of wave-particle ﬂip-ﬂop What is light? This question has haunted mankind for a long time. But systematic experiments were done by scientists since the dawn of the scientific and industrial era, about four centuries ago. Around the same time, theoretical models about what light is made of were developed. While building a model in any branch of science, it is essential to see that it is able to explain all the experimental observations existing at that time. It is therefore appropriate to summarize some observations about light that were known in the seventeenth century. The properties of light known at that time included (a) rectilinear propagation of light, (b) reﬂection from plane and curved surfaces, [c] refraction at the boundary of two media, [d] dispersion into various colours, [e] high speed. Appropriate laws were formulated for the first four phenomena. For example, Snell formulated his laws of refraction in 1621. Several scientists right from the days of Galileo had tried to measure the speed of light. But they had not been able to do so. They had only concluded that it was higher than the limit of their measurement. Two models of light were also proposed in the seventeenth century. Descartes, in early decades of seventeenth century, proposed that light consists of particles, while Huygens, around 1650—60, proposed that light consists of waves. Descartes’ proposal was merely a philosophical model, devoid of any experiments or scientific arguments. Newton soon after, around 1660-70, extended Descartes’ particle model, known as corpuscular theory, built it up as a scientific theory, and explained various known properties with it. These models, light as waves and as particles, in a sense, are quite opposite of each other. But both models could explain all the known properties of light. There was nothing to choose between them. The history of the development of these models over the next few centuries is interesting. Bartholinus, in 1669, discovered double refraction of light in some crystals, and Huygens, in 1678, was quick to explain it on the basis of his wave theory of light. In spite of this, for over one hundred years, Newton’s particle model was firmly believed and preferred over the wave model. This was partly because of its simplicity and partly because of Newton’s inﬂuence on contemporary physics. Then in 180 1, Young performed his double-slit experiment and observed interference fringes. This phenomenon could be explained only by wave theory. It was realized that diffraction was also another phenomenon which could be explained only by wave theory. In fact, it was a natural consequence of Huygens idea of secondary wavelets emanating from every point in the path of light. These experiments could not be explained by assuming that light consists of particles. Another phenomenon of polarisation was discovered around 1810, and this too could be naturally explained by the wave theory. Thus wave theory of Huygens came to the forefront and Newton’s particle theory went into the background. This situation again continued for almost a century. Better experiments were performed in the nineteenth century to determine the speed of light. With more accurate experiments, a value of 3X 108 m/ s for speed of light in vacuum was arrived at. Around 1860, Maxwell proposed his equations of electromagnetism and it was realized that all electromagnetic phenomena known at that time could be explained by Maxwell’s four equations. Soon Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields could propagate through empty space [vacuum] in the form of electromagnetic waves. He calculated the speed of these waves and arrived at a theoretical value of 2.998X 108 m/s. The close agreement of this value with the experimental value suggested that light consists of electromagnetic waves. In 1887 Hertz demonstrated the generation and detection of such waves. This established the wave theory of light on a firm footing. We might say that while eighteenth century belonged to the particle model, the nineteenth century belonged to the wave model of light. Vast amounts of experiments were done during the period 1850— 1900 on heat and related phenomena, an altogether different area of physics. Theories and models like kinetic theory and thermodynamics were developed which quite successfully explained the various phenomena, except one. 412 2019-20",0

This ability leads to the formation of different plant bodies - haploid and diploid. The haploid plant body produces gametes by mitosis. This plant body represents a gametophyte. Following fertilisation the zygote also divides by mitosis to produce a diploid sporophytic plant body. Haploid spores are produced by this plant body by meiosis. These in turn, divide by mitosis to form a haploid plant body once again. Thus, during the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is an alternation of generations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing diploid sporophyte. However, different plant groups, as well as individuals representing them, differ in the following patterns: 1. Sporophytic generation is represented only by the one-celled zygote. There are no free-living sporophytes. Meiosis in the zygote results in the formation of haploid spores. The haploid spores divide mitotically and form the gametophyte. The dominant, photosynthetic phase in such plants is the free-living gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is termed as haplontic. Many algae such as Volvox, Spirogyra and some species of Chlamydomonas represent this pattern (Figure 3.7 a). 2. On the other extreme, is the type wherein the diploid sporophyte is the dominant, photosynthetic, independent phase of the plant. The gametophytic phase is represented by the single to few-celled haploid gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is termed as diplontic. An alga, Fucus sp., represents this pattern (Fig. 3.7 b). In addition, all seed bearing plants i.e., gymnosperms and angiosperms, follow this pattern with some variations, wherein, the gametophytic phase is few to multi-celled. 3. Bryophytes and pteridophytes, interestingly, exhibit an intermediate condition (Haplo-diplontic); both Figure 3.7 Life cycle patterns : (a) Haplontic phases are multicellular.

This movement of electrons is downhill, in terms of an oxidation-reduction or redox potential scale. The electrons are not used up as they pass through the electron transport chain, but are passed on to the pigments of photosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons in the reaction centre of PS I are also excited when they receive red light of wavelength 700 nm and are transferred to another accepter molecule that has a greater redox potential. These electrons then are moved downhill again, this time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP’“. The addition of these electrons reduces NADP+ to NADPH + H“. This whole scheme of transfer of electrons, starting from the PS 11, uphill to the acceptor, down the electron transport chain to PS I, excitation of electrons, transfer to another acceptor, and ﬁnally down hill to NADP+ reducing it to NADPH + H+ is called the Z scheme, due to its characterstic shape (Figure 13.5). This shape is formed when all the carriers are placed in a sequence on a redox potential scale. 13.6. 1 Splitting of Water You would then ask, How does PS II supply electrons continuously? The electrons that were moved from photosystem 11 must be replaced. This is achieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of water is associated with the PS 11; water is split into 2H“, [0] and electrons. This creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis. The electrons needed to replace those removed from photosystem I are provided by photosystem II. We need to emphasise here that the water splitting complex is associated with the PS 11, which itself is physically located on the inner side of the membrane of the thylakoid. Then, where are the protons and 02 formed likely to be released — in the lumen? or on the outer side of the membrane? 13.6.2 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Photo-phosphorylation Living organisms have the capability of extracting energy from oxidisable substances and store this in the form ofbond energy.

You may wonder how a single cell then goes on to form such large organisms. Growth and reproduction are characteristics of cells, indeed of all living organisms. All cells reproduce by dividing into two, with each parental cell giving rise to two daughter cells each time they divide. These newly formed daughter cells can themselves grow and divide, giving rise to a new cell population that is formed by the growth and division of a single parental cell and its progeny. In other words, such cycles of growth and division allow a single cell to form a structure consisting of millions of cells. 10. 1 CELL CYCLE Cell division is a very important process in all living organisms. During the division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. All these processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence, have to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division and formation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the other constituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells is termed cell cycle. Although cell growth (in terms of cytoplasmic increase) is a continuous process, DNA synthesis occurs only during one speciﬁc stage in the cell cycle. The replicated chromosomes (DNA) are then distributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events during cell division. These events are themselves under genetic control. 2019-2020",1

It helps in grinding the soil particles and decaying leaves, etc. The stomach extends from 9- 14 segments. The food of the earthworm is decaying leaves and organic matter mixed with soil. Calciferous glands, present in the stomach, neutralise the humic acid present in humus. Intestine starts from the 15th segment onwards and continues till the last segment. A pair of short and conical intestinal caecae project from the intestine on the 26‘11 segment. The characteristic feature of the intestine after 26th segment except the last 2301-25th segments is the presence of internal median fold of dorsal wall called typhlosole. This increases the effective area of absorption in the intestine. The alimentary canal opens to the exterior by a small rounded aperture called anus. The ingested organic rich soil passes through the digestive tract where digestive enzymes breakdown complex food into smaller absorbable units. These simpler molecules are absorbed through intestinal membranes and are utilised. Pheretima exhibits a closed type of blood vascular system, consisting of blood vessels, capillaries and heart.

Its motion down the plane is such that all the particles of the body are moving together, i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant of time.

Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane (Fig. 7.2). The rigid body in this problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus, seems to have translational motion. But as Fig. 7 .2 shows, all its particles are not moving with the same velocity at any instant. The body, therefore, is not in pure translational motion. Its motion is translational plus ‘something else.’ B C Fig. 7.2 Rolling motion of a cylinder. It is not pure translational motion.

Would you expect a greater or smaller dip angle in Britain? If you made a map of magnetic field lines at Melbourne in Australia, would the lines seem to go into the ground or come out of the ground? In which direction would a compass free to move in the vertical plane point to, if located right on the geomagnetic north or south pole? The earth’s field, it is claimed, roughly approximates the field due to a dipole of magnetic moment 8 X 1022 J T1 located at its centre. Check the order of magnitude of this number in some way. Geologists claim that besides the main magnetic N-S poles, there are several local poles on the earth’s surface oriented in different directions. How is such a thing possible at all? 5.2 Answer the following questions: (a) (b) (C) (d) (e) (f) The earth’s magnetic field varies from point to point in space. Does it also change with time? If so, on what time scale does it change appreciably? The earth’s core is known to contain iron. Yet geologists do not regard this as a source of the earth’s magnetism. Why? The charged currents in the outer conducting regions of the earth’s core are thought to be responsible for earth’s magnetism. What might be the ‘battery’ (i.e., the source of energy) to sustain these currents? The earth may have even reversed the direction of its field several times during its history of 4 to 5 billion years. How can geologists know about the earth’s field in such distant past? The earth’s field departs from its dipole shape substantially at large distances (greater than about 30,000 km). What agencies may be responsible for this distortion? Interstellar space has an extremely weak magnetic field of the order of 10’12 T. Can such a weak field be of any significant consequence? Explain.

679,939,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS water. A seed may appear dry but it still has water — otherwise it would not be alive and respiring! Terrestrial plants take up huge amount water daily but most of it is lost to the air through evaporation from the leaves, i.e., transpiration. A mature corn plant absorbs almost three litres of water in a day, while a mustard plant absorbs water equal to its own weight in about 5 hours. Because of this high demand for water, it is not surprising that water is often the limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both agricultural and natural environments. 1 1 .2. 1 Water Potential To comprehend plant-water relations, an understanding of certain standard terms is necessary. Water potential (WW) is a concept fundamental to understanding water movement. Solute potential 01’s) and pressure potential (WP) are the two main components that determine water potential. Water molecules possess kinetic energy. In liquid and gaseous form they are in random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater the concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or ‘water potential’. Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest water potential. If two systems containing water are in contact, random movement of water molecules will result in net movement of water molecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy. Thus water will move from the system containing water at higher water potential to the one having low water potential This process of movement of substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion. Water potential is denoted by the Greek symbol Psi or ‘l‘ and is expressed in pressure units such as pascals (Pa). By convention, the water potential of pure water at standard temperatures, which is not under any pressure, is taken to be zero. If some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free water molecules and the concentration (free energy) of water decreases, reducing its water potential. Hence, all solutions have a lower water potential than pure water; the magnitude of this lowering due to dissolution of a solute is called solute potential or ‘PS. ‘1; is always negative. The more the solute molecules, the lower (more negative) is the ‘PS . For a solution at atmospheric pressure (water potential) ‘Pw = (solute potential) ‘PS. If a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure water or a solution, its water potential increases. It is equivalent to pumping water from one place to another. Can you think of any system in our body where pressure is built up? Pressure can build up in a plant system when water enters a plant cell due to diffusion causing a pressure built up against the cell wall, it makes the cell turgid (see section 1 1.2.2); 179",1

681,1118,"F2 generation Figure 5.3 Diagrammatic representation 72 Parental F1 generation BIOLOGY Based on these observations, Mendel proposed that something was being stably passed down, unchanged, from parent to offspring through the gametes, over successive generations. He called these things as ‘factors’. Now we call them as genes. Genes, therefore, are the units of inheritance. They contain the information that is required to express a particular trait in an organism. Genes which code for a pair of contrasting traits are known as alleles, i.e., they are slightly different forms of the same gene. If we use alphabetical symbols for each gene, then the capital letter is used for the trait expressed at the F1 stage and the small alphabet for the other trait. For example, in case of the character of height, T is used for the Tall trait and t for the ‘dwarf’, and T and t are alleles of each other. Hence, in plants the pair of alleles for height would be TT, Tt or tt. Mendel also proposed that in a true of monohybrid cross breeding, tall or dwarf pea variety the allelic pair of genes for height are identical or homozygous, TT and tt, respectively. TT and tt are called the genotype of the plant while the descriptive terms tall and dwarf are the phenotype. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a genotype Tt? As Mendel found the phenotype of the F1 heterozygote Tt to be exactly like the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar factors, one dominates the other (as in the F1) and hence is called the dominant factor while the other factor is recessive . In this case T (for tallness) is dominant over t (for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed identical behaviour for all the other characters / trait-pairs that he studied. It is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an alphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and recessiveness. (Do not use T for tall and d for dwarf because you will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to remember whether T and d are alleles of the same gene / character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes TT and tt or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote Tt. Since Dwarf 2019—2020",1

684,510,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS We can rearrange the above terms to obtain 1 1 P1+(§) p012 + pgh1= P2+ (5] p022 + [)th (10.12) This is Bernoulli’s equation. Since 1 and 2 refer to any two locations along the pipeline, we may write the expression in general as E 1 P+ ( )pv2 + pgh = constant (10.13) Fig. 10.9 The ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid in a pipe of varying cross section. The ﬂuid in a section of length v 1At moves to the section of length vZAt in time At. In words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be stated as follows: As we move along a streamline the sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy pv2 per unit volume [ 2 j and the potential energy per unit volume (p gh) remains a constant. Note that in applying the energy conservation principle, there is an assumption that no energy is lost due to friction. But in fact, when ﬂuids ﬂow. some energy does get lost due to internal friction. This arises due to the fact that in a ﬂuid ﬂow, the different layers of the ﬂuid ﬂow with different velocities. These layers exert frictional forces on each other resulting in a loss of energy. This property of the ﬂuid is called viscosity and is discussed in more detail in a later section. The lost kinetic energy of the ﬂuid gets converted into heat energy. Thus, Bernoulli’s equation ideally applies to ﬂuids with zero viscosity or non-viscous ﬂuids. Another restriction on application of Bernoulli theorem is that the ﬂuids must be incompressible, as the elastic energy of the ﬂuid is also not taken into consideration. In practice, it has a large number of useful applications and can help explain a wide variety of phenomena for low viscosity incompressible ﬂuids. Bernoulli’s equation also does not hold for non-steady or turbulent ﬂows, because in that situation velocity and pressure are constantly ﬂuctuating in time. When a ﬂuid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero everywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes P1+ pgh1= P2 + pgh. (Pl—P2) = pg (’12—’11) which is same as Eq. (10.6). 10.4.1 Speed of Efﬂux: Torricelli's Law The word efﬂux means ﬂuid outﬂow. Torricelli discovered that the speed of efﬂux from an open tank is given by a formula identical to that of a freely falling body. Consider a tank containing a liquid of density p with a small hole in its side at a height yl from the bottom (see Fig. 10.10). The air above the liquid, whose surface is at height y2. is at pressure P. From the equation of continuity [Eq. (10. 10)] we have v1A1=v2A2 A1 v 2—D 2 A2 1 Fig. 10.10 Torricelli’s law. The speed of efﬂux, v1, from the side of the container is given by the application of Bernoulli’s equation. If the container is open at the top to the atmosphere then v1 = ./2 g h . 2019-20",0

686,950,"HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE 8.5.2 Addiction and Dependence Because of the perceived beneﬁts, drugs are frequently used repeatedly. The most important thing, which one fails to realise, is the inherent addictive nature of alcohol and drugs. Addiction is a psychological attachment to certain effects —such as euphoria and a temporary feeling of well-being —associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to take them even when these are not needed, or even when their use becomes self-destructive. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the receptors present in our body increases. Consequently the receptors respond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading to greater intake and addiction. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that use of these drugs even once, can be a fore-runner to addiction. Thus, the addictive potential of drugs and alcohol, pull the user into a Vicious circle leading to their regular use (abuse) from which he / she may not be able to get out. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets addicted and becomes dependent on their use. Dependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic and unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular dose of drugs / alcohol is abruptly discontinued. This is characterised by anxiety, shakiness, nausea and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed again. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life threatening and the person may need medical supervision. Dependence leads the patient to ignore all social norms in order to get sufficient funds to satiate his / her needs. These result in many social adjustment problems. 8.5.3 Effects of Drug/Alcohol Abuse The immediate adverse effects of drugs and alcohol abuse are manifested in the form of reckless behaviour, vandalism and violence. Excessive doses of drugs may lead to coma and death due to respiratory failure, heart failure or cerebral hemorrhage. A combination of drugs or their intake along with alcohol generally results in overdosing and even deaths. The most common warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse among youth include drop in academic performance, unexplained absence from school/ college, lack of interest in personal hygiene, withdrawal, isolation, depression, fatigue, aggressive and rebellious behaviour, deteriorating relationships with family and friends, loss of interest in hobbies, change in sleeping and eating habits, ﬂuctuations in weight, appetite, etc. There may even be some far-reaching implications of drug/ alcohol abuse. If an abuser is unable to get money to buy drugs / alcohol he / she may turn to stealing. The adverse effects are just not restricted to the person who is using drugs or alcohol. At times, a drug/ alcohol addict becomes the cause of mental and ﬁnancial distress to his / her entire family and friends. 2019—2020",1

Thus, these two sections make no contribution. Let the ﬁeld along ab be B. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h. Let n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number of turns is nh. The enclosed current is, Ie= I (n h), where I is the current in the solenoid. From Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.1 7 (b)] BL = #018, B h = #01 (n h) B = #0 n I (4.20) The direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid is commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. We shall see in the next chapter that a large ﬁeld is possible by inserting a soft iron core inside the solenoid. 4.8.2 The toroid The toroid is a hollow circular ring on which a large number of turns of a wire are closely wound. It can be viewed as a solenoid which has been bent into a circular shape to close on itself. It is shown in Fig. 4. 19(a) carrying a current I. We shall see that the magnetic ﬁeld in the open space inside (point P) and exterior to the toroid (point Q) is zero. The field B inside the toroid is constant in magnitude for the (a) ideal toroid of closely wound turns. Figure 4. 19(b) shows a sectional view of the toroid. The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld inside is clockwise as per the right-hand thumb rule for circular loops. Three circular Amperian loops 1, 2 and 3 are shown by dashed lines. By symmetry, the magnetic ﬁeld should be tangential to each of them and constant in magnitude for a given loop. The circular areas bounded by loops 2 and 3 both cut the toroid: so that each turn of current carrying wire is cut once by the loop 2 and twice by the loop 3. Let the magnetic field along loop 1 be B1 in magnitude. Then in Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4. l7(a)], L = 2?: r1. However, the loop encloses no current, so 19 = 0.

This is what happens for water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene oil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps, detergents and dying substances are wetting agents. When they are added the angle of contact becomes small so that these may penetrate well and become effective. Water proofing agents on the other hand are added to create a large angle of contact between the water and fibres. 10.6.4 Drops and Bubbles One consequence of surface tension is that free liquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects of gravity can be neglected. You must have seen this especially clearly in small drops just formed in a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles blown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops and bubbles spherical? What keeps soap bubbles stable? As we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid- air interface has energy, so for a given volume the surface with minimum energy is the one with the least area. The sphere has this property. Though it is out of the scope of this book, but you can check that a sphere is better than at least a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and other forces (e. g. air resistance) were ineffective, liquid drops would be spherical. Another interesting consequence of surface tension is that the pressure inside a spherical drop Fig. 10.20(a) is more than the pressure outside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is in equilibrium. If its radius increase by Ar. The extra surface energy is [47c(r + Ar) 2- 47cr2] Sla = 87cr Ar Sla (10.25) If the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is balanced by the energy gain due to expansion under the pressure difference (Pi — P0) between the inside of the bubble and the outside. The work done is W= (Pi — P0) 47512Ar (10.26) so that (Pi — P0) = (2 Sla/ r) (10.27) 2019-20 In general, for a liquid-gas interface, the convex side has a higher pressure than the concave side. For example, an air bubble in a liquid, would have higher pressure inside it. See Fig 10.20 (b). (a) (b) Fig. 1 0.20 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r. A bubble Fig 10.20 (c) differs from a drop and a cavity; in this it has two interfaces. Applying the above argument we have for a bubble (P, — P0) = (4 s,,/ r) (10.28) This is probably why you have to blow hard, but not too hard, to form a soap bubble. A little extra air pressure is needed inside! 10.6.5 Capillary Rise One consequence of the pressure difference across a curved liquid-air interface is the well- known effect that water rises up in a narrow tube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means hair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise would be very large. To see this, consider a vertical capillary tube of circular cross section (radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water (Fig. 10.21).

692,1370,"BIOLOGY contact with the infected persons or their belongings should be avoided. For diseases such as malaria and filariasis that are transmitted through insect vectors, the most important measure is to control or eliminate the vectors and their breeding places. This can be achieved by avoiding stagnation of water in and around residential areas, regular cleaning of household coolers, use of mosquito nets, introducing ﬁshes like Gambusia in ponds that feed on mosquito larvae, spraying of insecticides in ditches, drainage areas and swamps, etc. In addition, doors and windows should be provided with wire mesh to prevent the entry of mosquitoes. Such precautions have become more important especially in the light of recent widespread incidences of the vector-borne (Aedes mosquitoes) diseases like dengue and chikungunya in many parts of India. The advancements made in biological science have armed us to effectively deal with many infectious diseases. The use of vaccines and immunisation programmes have enabled us to completely eradicate a deadly disease like smallpox. A large number of other infectious diseases like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and tetanus have been controlled to a large extent by the use of vaccines. Biotechnology (about which you will read more in Chapter 12) is at the verge of making available newer and safer vaccines. Discovery of antibiotics and various other drugs has also enabled us to effectively treat infectious diseases. 8.2 IMMUNITY Everyday we are exposed to large number of infectious agents. However, only a few of these exposures result in disease. Why? This is due to the fact that the body is able to defend itself from most of these foreign agents. This overall ability of the host to ﬁght the disease-causing organisms, conferred by the immune system is called immunity. Immunity is of two types: (i) Innate immunity and (ii) Acquired immunity. 8.2. 1 Innate Immunity Innate immunity is non-specific type of defence, that is present at the time of birth. This is accomplished by providing different types of barriers to the entry of the foreign agents into our body. Innate immunity consist of four types of barriers. These are — (i) Physical barriers : Skin on our body is the main barrier which prevents entry of the micro-organisms. Mucus coating of the epithelium lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts also help in trapping microbes entering our body. (ii) Physiological barriers : Acid in the stomach, saliva in the mouth, tears from eyes—all prevent microbial growth. (iii) Cellular barriers : Certain types of leukocytes (WBC) of our body like polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNL—neutrophils) and 2019—2020",1

Overdraft is a situation when cash withdrawn from the bank exceeds the amount of deposit. Entries in respect of cheques received should be made in the bank column of the cash book. When a cheque is received, it may be deposited into the bank on the same day or it may be deposited on another day. In case, it is deposited on the same day the amount is recorded in the bank column of the cash book on the receipts side. If the cheque is deposited on another day, in that case, on the date of receipt it is treated as cash received and hence recorded in the cash column on the receipts side. On the day of deposit to the bank, it is shown in the Bank Column on receipt (Dr.) side and in the Cash Column on the payment (Cr.) side. This is a contra entry. If a cheque received from a customer is dishonoured, the bank will return the dishonoured cheque and debit the firm’s account. On receipt of such cheque or intimation from the bank, the firm will make an entry on the credit side of the cash book by entering the amount of the dishonoured cheque in the bank column and the name of the customer in the particulars column. This entry will restore the position prevailing before the receipt of the cheque form the customer and its deposit in the bank.

694,323,"398 l Physics 1 1.8 WAVE NATURE OF MATTER The dual (wave-particle) nature of light (electromagnetic radiation, in general) comes out clearly from what we have learnt in this and the preceding chapters. The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, in photoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve energy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it is made up of a bunch of particles — the photons. Whether a particle or wave description is best suited for understanding an experiment depends on the nature of the experiment. For example, in the familiar phenomenon of seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are important. The gathering and focussing mechanism of light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture. But its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina) requires the photon picture of light. A natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-particle) nature, might not the particles of nature (the electrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit wave-like character? In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie (pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the bold hypothesis that moving particles of matter should display wave-like properties under suitable conditions. He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the two basic physical entities — matter and energy, must have symmetrical character. If radiation shows dual aspects, so should matter. De Broglie proposed that the wave length it associated with a particle of momentum p is given as h h :_: __ (11.5) p mv where m is the mass of the particle and 0 its speed. Equation (1 1.5) is known as the de Broglie relation and the wavelength it of the matter wave is called de Broglie wavelength. The dual aspect of matter is evident in the de Broglie relation. On the left hand side of Eq. (1 1.5), 7» is the attribute of a wave while on the right hand side the momentum p is a typical attribute of a particle. Planck’s constant h relates the two attributes. Equation (1 1 . 5) for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose validity can be tested only by experiment. However, it is interesting to see that it is satisfied also by a photon. For a photon, as we have seen, p=hv /c (11.6) Therefore, h c ;=;=/l (11.7) That is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq. (1 1.5) equals the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a quantum of energy and momentum. Clearly, from Eq. (1 1.5 ), )L is smaller for a heavier particle (large m) or more energetic particle (large v). For example, the de Broglie wavelength of a ball of mass 0.12 kg moving with a speed of 20 m s‘1 is easily calculated: 2019-20",0
695,1172,"BIOLOGY The term health is very frequently used by everybody. How do we deﬁne it? Health does not simply mean ‘absence of disease’ or ‘physical ﬁtness’. It could be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at work. This increases productivity and brings economic prosperity. Health also increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal mortality. Balanced diet, personal hygiene and regular exercise are very important to maintain good health. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial to achieve physical and mental health. Awareness about diseases and their effect on different bodily functions, vaccination (immunisation) against infectious diseases, proper disposal of wastes, control of vectors and maintenance of hygiene in food and water resources are necessary for achieving good health. When the functioning of one or more organs or systems of the body is adversely affected, characterised by appearance of various signs and symptoms, we say that we are not healthy, i.e., we have a disease. Diseases can be broadly grouped into infectious and non-infectious. Diseases which are easily transmitted from one person to another, are called infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are very common and every one of us suffers from these at sometime or other. Some of the infectious diseases like AIDS are fatal. Among non-infectious diseases, cancer is the major cause of death. Drug and alcohol abuse also affect our health adversely. 8.1 COMMON DISEASES IN HUMANS A wide range of organisms belonging to bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoans, helminths, etc., could cause diseases in man. Such disease- causing organisms are called pathogens. Most parasites are therefore pathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. The pathogens can enter our body by various means, multiply and interfere with normal vital activities, resulting in morphological and functional damage. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the host. For example, the pathogens that enter the gut must know a way of survian in the stomach at low pH and resisting the various digestive enzymes. A few representative members from different groups of pathogenic organisms are discussed here alongwith the diseases caused by them. Preventive and control measures against these diseases in general, are also brieﬂy described. Salmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium which causes typhoid fever in human beings. These pathogens generally enter the small intestine through food and water contaminated with them and migrate to other organs through blood. Sustained high fever (39° to 40°C), weakness, stomach pain, constipation, headache and loss of appetite are some of the common symptoms of this disease. Intestinal perforation and death may occur in severe cases. Typhoid fever could be confirmed by 2019-2020",1

697,172,"370 PHYSICS sinusoidal wave will be generated propagating in air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly an example of longitudinal waves. The waves considered above, transverse or longitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves since they travel from one part of the medium to another. The material medium as a whole does not move, as already noted. A stream, for example, constitutes motion of water as a whole. In a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves, not water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion of air as a whole) should not be confused with a sound wave which is a propagation of disturbance (in pressure density) in air, without the motion of air medium as a whole. In transverse waves, the particle motion is normal to the direction of propagation of the wave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each element of the medium undergoes a shearing strain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be propagated only in those media, which can sustain shearing stress, such as solids and not in ﬂuids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain compressive strain; therefore, longitudinal waves can be propagated in all elastic media. For example, in medium like steel, both transverse and longitudinal waves can propagate, while air can sustain only longitudinal waves. The waves on the surface of water are of two kinds: capillary waves and gravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly short wavelength—not more than a few centimetre—and the restoring force that produces them is the surface tension of water. Gravity waves have wavelengths typically ranging from several metres to several hundred meters. The restoring force that produces these waves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep the water surface at its lowest level. The oscillations of the particles in these waves are not confined to the surface only, but extend with diminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The particle motion in water waves involves a complicated motion—they not only move up and down but also back and forth. The waves in an ocean are the combination of both longitudinal and transverse waves. It is found that, generally, transverse and longitudinal waves travel with different speed in the same medium. 2019-20 Example 1 5. 1 Given below are some examples of wave motion. State in each case if the. wave motion is transverse. longitudinal or a combination of both: (a) Motion of a lq'nk in a longitudinal spring produced by displacing one end of the spring sideways.

Answer (a) Transverse and longitudinal (b) Longitudinal (c) Transverse and longitudinal (d) Longitudinal 4 15.3 DISPLACEMENT RELATION IN APROGRESSIVEWAVE For mathematical description of a travelling wave, we need a function of both position x and time t. Such a function at every instant should give the shape of the wave at that instant. Also, at every given location, it should describe the motion of the constituent of the medium at that location. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal travelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig. 15.3) the corresponding function must also be sinusoidal. For convenience, we shall take the wave to be transverse so that if the position of the constituents of the medium is denoted by x, the displacement from the equilibrium position may be denoted by y. A sinusoidal travelling wave is then described by: y(x,t) = asin(kx—0)t+q)) (15.2) The term {/5 in the argument of sine function means equivalently that we are considering a linear combination of sine and cosine functions: y(x,t) = A sinUoc — cot) + Bcos(kx — cot) (15.3) From Equations (15.2) and (15.3), B a=\/A2 +B2 and ¢= tan'1(Z) To understand why Equation (15.2) represents a sinusoidal travelling wave, take a fixed instant, say t= to.

Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M LZT‘2A‘2] given by the dimensions of ﬂux divided by the dimensions of current. The SI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H. It is named in honour of Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA, independently of Faraday in England. 6.9. 1 Mutual inductance Consider Fig. 6. 1 5 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length i. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S1 by r1 and the number of turns per unit length by n1. The corresponding quantities for the outer solenoid S2 are r2 and n2, respectively. Let N1 and N2 be the total number of turns of coils S1 and S2, respectively. When a current I2 is set up through S , it in turn sets up a magnetic ﬂux through SI. Let us denote it by (1)1. The corresponding ﬂux linkage with solenoid S1 is N1 951 = M1212 (6.9) M12 is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S1 with respect to solenoid S2. It is also referred to as the coefﬁcient of mutual induction. For these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to calculate M12. The magnetic ﬁeld due to the current I2 in S2 is ,uon212. The resulting ﬂux linkage with coil S1 is, N1? = (nil) (TU-12) (#011212) = ,uon1n27tr121 12 (6.10) where nllis the total number of turns in solenoid SI. Thus, from Eq. (6.9) and Eq.

This is a good approximation keeping in mind that the solenoid is long, implying 1 >> r2. We now consider the reverse case. A current I1 is passed through the solenoid S1 and the ﬂux linkage with coil S2 is, N243 = M I (6.12) 211 M21 is called the mutual inductance of solenoid 82 with respect to solenoid SI.

Cell junctions fuse the plasma membranes of cardiac muscle cells and make them stick together (Figure 7.70).

701,736,"MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS N (fl OJ Fig. 1 0.3 Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is illustrated through pressure on a vertical cylindrical column. Pressure difference depends on the vertical distance h between the points (1 and 2), mass density of the ﬂuid p and acceleration due to gravity 9. If the point 1 under discussion is shifted to the top of the ﬂuid (say, water), which is open to the atmosphere, P1 may be replaced by atmospheric pressure (Pa) and we replace P2 by P. Then Eq. (10.6) gives P=Pa+pgh (10.7) Thus, the pressure P, at depth below the surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is greater than atmospheric pressure by an amount pgh. The excess of pressure, P —Pa, at depth h is called a gauge pressure at that point. The area of the cylinder is not appearing in the expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (10.7 ). Thus, the height of the ﬂuid column is important and not cross-sectional or base area or the shape of the container. The liquid pressure is the same at all points at the same horizontal level (same depth). The result is appreciated through the example of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three vessels A, B and C [Fig.10.4] of different shapes. They are connected at the bottom by a horizontal pipe. On filling with water, the level in the three vessels is the same, though they hold different amounts of water. This is so because water at the bottom has the same pressure below each section of the vessel. Fig 10.4 Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The three vessels A, B and C contain different amounts of liquids, all upto the same height. Example 10.2 What is the pressure on a swimmer 10 m below the surface ofa lake? Answer Here h = 10 m andp = 1000 kg m'3. Take g = 10 m s-2 From Eq. (10.7) P = Pa + p gh = 1.01 x 105 Pa+ 1000kgm*3 x 10 ms—2 >< 10m = 2.01 x 105 Pa z 2 atm This is a 100% increase in pressure from surface level. At a depth of 1 km, the increase in pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed to withstand such enormous pressures. 4 10.2.3 Atmospheric Pressure and Gauge Pressure The pressure of the atmosphere at any point is equal to the weight of a column of air of unit cross-sectional area extending from that point to the top of the atmosphere. At sea level, it is 1.0 13 x 105 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli (1608—1647) devised for the first time a method for measuring atmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed at one end and filled with mercury is inverted into a trough of mercury as shown in Fig. 10.5 (a). This device is known as ‘mercury barometer’. The space above the mercury column in the tube contains only mercury vapour whose pressure P is so small that it may be neglected. Thus, the pressure at Point A=0. The pressure inside the coloumn at Point B must be the same as the pressure at Point C, which is atmospheric pressure, Pa. Pa = p gh (10.8) where p is the density of mercury and h is the height of the mercury column in the tube. 2019-20",0
702,985,"REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS and physiology, when it comes to sexual mode of reproduction, surprisingly, they share a similar pattern. Let us ﬁrst discuss what features are common to these diverse organisms. All organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in their life, before they can reproduce sexually. That period of growth is called the juvenile phase. It is known as vegetative phase in plants. This phase is of variable durations in different organisms. The end of juvenile/ vegetative phase which marks the beginning of the reproductive phase can be seen easily in the higher plants when they come to ﬂower. How long does it take for marigold/rice/wheat/coconut/ mango plants to come to ﬂower? In some plants, where ﬂowering occurs more than once, what would you call the inter-ﬂowering period — j uvenile or mature? Observe a few trees in your area. Do they ﬂower during the same month year after year? Why do you think the availability of fruits like mango, apple, jackfruit, etc., is seasonal? Are there some plants that ﬂower throughout the year and some others that show seasonal ﬂowering? Plants—the annual and biennial types, show clear cut vegetative, reproductive and senescent phases, but in the perennial species it is very difﬁcult to clearly define these phases. A few plants exhibit unusual ﬂowering phenomenon; some of them such as bamboo species ﬂower only once in their life time, generally after 50- 100 years, produce large number of fruits and die. Another plant, Strobilanthus kunthiana (neelakuranji), ﬂowers once in 12 years. As many of you would know, this plant ﬂowered during September-October 2006. Its mass ﬂowering transformed large tracks of hilly areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into blue stretches and attracted a large number of tourists. In animals, the juvenile phase is followed by morphological and physiological changes prior to active reproductive behaviour. The reproductive phase is also of variable duration in different organisms. Can you list the changes seen in human beings that are indicative of reproductive maturity? Among animals, for example birds, do they lay eggs all through the year? Or is it a seasonal phenomenon? What about other animals like frogs and lizards? You will notice that, birds living in nature lay eggs only seasonally. However, birds in captivity (as in poultry farms) can be made to lay eggs throughout the year. In this case, laying eggs is not related to reproduction but is a commercial exploitation for human welfare. The females of placental mammals exhibit cyclical changes in the activities of ovaries and accessory ducts as well as hormones during the reproductive phase. In non-primate mammals like cows, sheep, rats, deers, dogs, tiger, etc., such cyclical changes during reproduction are called oestrus cycle where as in primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) it is called menstrual cycle. Many mammals, especially those living in natural, wild conditions exhibit such cycles only during favourable seasons in their reproductive 2019-2020",1

According to the new deﬁnition, Pluto is no longer a planet. This means that the Solar System consists of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. According to the IAU usage, the ‘planet’ and ‘other bodies’ in our Solar System, except satellites, are to be deﬁned into three distinct categories of celestial objects in the following way: 1. A ‘planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. 2. A ‘dwarf planet’ is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite. 3.

705,1225,"182 BIOLOGY Plasmolysed Figure 11.5 Plant cell plasmolysis the cell (or tissue) is placed in a solution that is hypertonic (has more solutes) to the protoplasm. Water moves out; it is ﬁrst lost from the cytoplasm and then from the vacuole. The water when drawn out of the cell through diffusion into the extracellular (outside cell) ﬂuid causes the protoplast to shrink away from the walls. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. The movement of water occurred across the membrane moving from an area of high water potential (i.e., the cell) to an area of lower water potential outside the cell (Figure 1 1.5). What occupies the space between the cell wall and the shrunken protoplast in the plasmolysed cell? When the cell (or tissue) is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no net ﬂow of water towards the inside or outside. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm it is said to be isotonic. When water ﬂows into the cell and out of the cell and are in equilibrium, the cells are said to be ﬂaccid. The process of plasmolysis is usually reversible. When the cells are placed in a hypotonic solution (higher water potential or dilute solution as compared to the cytoplasm), water diffuses into the cell causing the cytoplasm to build up a pressure against the wall, that is called turgor pressure. The pressure exerted by the protoplasts due to entry of water against the rigid walls is called pressure potential ‘Pp. Because of the rigidity of the cell wall, the cell does not rupture. This turgor pressure is ultimately responsible for enlargement and extension growth of cells. What would be the WP of a flaccid cell? Which organisms other than plants possess cell wall ? 1 1 .2.4 Imbibition Imbibition is a special type of diffusion when water is absorbed by solids — colloids — causing them to increase in volume.

Now if the two sources are coherent (i.e., if the two needles are going up and down regularly) then the phase difference ¢ at any point will not change with time and we will have a stable interference pattern; i.e., the positions of maxima and minima will not change with time. However, if the two needles do not maintain a constant phase difference, then the interference pattern will also change with time and, if the phase difference changes very rapidly with time, the positions of maXima and minima will also vary rapidly with time and we will see a “time-averaged” intensity distribution. When this happens, we will observe an average intensity that will be given by <I>=410 <cos2(¢/2)> (10.13) where angular brackets represent time averaging. Indeed it is shown in Section 7.2 that if ¢(t) varies randomly with time, the time-averaged quantity < cos2 (¢/ 2) > will be 1 / 2. This is also intuitively obvious because the function cos2 (¢/ 2) will randomly vary between 0 and 1 and the average value will be 1 / 2. The resultant intensity will be given by 1:210 (10.14) at all points. When the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes rapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when this happens the intensities just add up.

Hence, no work is required to bring any charge to point E. 2.8 POTENTIAL ENERGY IN AN EXTERNAL FIELD 2.8. 1 Potential energy of a single charge In Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was speciﬁed — the charges and their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges was determined. In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question. What is the potential energy of a charge q in a given ﬁeld? This question was, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic potential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again to clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2. 7. The main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential energy of a charge (or charges) in an external ﬁeld. The external ﬁeld E is not produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to calculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The external sources may be known, but often they are unknown or unspeciﬁed; what is speciﬁed is the electric ﬁeld E or the electrostatic potential Vdue to the external sources. We assume that the charge q does not signiﬁcantly affect the sources producing the external ﬁeld. This is true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other unspeciﬁed forces. Even if q is ﬁnite, its inﬂuence on the external sources may still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away at inﬁnity produce a ﬁnite field E in the region of interest. Note again that we are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q (and later, a system of charges) in the external ﬁeld; we are not interested in the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric ﬁeld. The external electric ﬁeld E and the corresponding external potential Vmay vary from point to point. By definition, Vat a point P is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from inﬁnity to the point P. 2019-20",0

713,412,"Electric Charges and Fields where n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is the charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written as —e and that on a proton as +e. The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed as quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics where certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by Millikan in l 9 1 2. In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a coulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is deﬁned in terms the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge ﬂowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is l A (ampere), (see Chapter 2 of Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the basic unit of charge is e = 1.602192 x 10—190 Thus, there are about 6 X 1018 electrons in a charge of —1C. In electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered and hence we use smaller units l “C (micro coulomb) = 1043 C or 1 mC (milli coulomb) = 10—3 c. If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount of charge on the body is n2 X e + n1 X (—e) = (n2 — n1) e. Since n1 and n2 are integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps of e. The step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic level, we deal with charges of a few ”C. At this scale the fact that charge of a body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect, the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous. This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution. At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous compared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 X 10‘19 C, a charge of magnitude, say l ”C, contains something like 1013 times the electronic charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in units of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no practical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds of e, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and 2019-20",0

Also note that though only the charge enclosed by the surface (Al) was included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire wire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial. Without this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved part of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (1.32) is approximately true for electric ﬁeld around the central portions of a long wire, where the end effects may be ignored. 1. 15.2 Field due to a uniformly charged inﬁnite plane sheet Let a be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet (Fig. 1.30).

It is convenient to resolve a general vector along the axes of a rectangular coordinate system using vectors of unit magnitude. These are called unit vectors that we discuss now.

718,1342,"(i) (ii) BIOLOGY Regulate: Some organisms are able to maintain homeostasis by physiological (sometimes behavioural also) means which ensures constant body temperature, constant osmotic concentration, etc. All birds and mammals, and a very few lower vertebrate and invertebrate species are indeed capable of such regulation (thermoregulation and osmoregulation). Evolutionary biologists believe that the ‘success’ of mammals is largely due to their ability to maintain a constant body temperature and thrive whether they live in Antarctica or in the Sahara desert. The mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate their body temperature are similar to the ones that we humans use. We maintain a constant body temperature of 37°C. In summer, when outside temperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat profusely. The resulting evaporative cooling, similar to what happens with a desert cooler in operation, brings down the body temperature. In winter when the temperature is much lower than 37 0C, we start to shiver, a kind of exercise which produces heat and raises the body temperature. Plants, on the other hand, do not have such mechanisms to maintain internal temperatures. Conform : An overwhelming majority (99 per cent) of animals and nearly all plants cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature changes with the ambient temperature. In aquatic animals, the osmotic concentration of the body ﬂuids change with that of the ambient air, water osmotic concentration. These animals and plants are simply conformers. Considering the beneﬁts of a constant internal environment to the organism, we must ask why these conformers had not evolved to become regulators. Recall the human analogy we used above; much as they like, how many people can really afford an air conditioner? Many simply ‘sweat it out’ and resign themselves to suboptimal performance in hot summer months. Thermoregulation is energetically expensive for many organisms. This is particularly true for small animals like shrews and humming birds. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside; then they have to expend much energy to generate body heat through metabolism. This is the main reason why very small animals are rarely found in polar regions. During the course of evolution, the costs and beneﬁts of maintaining a constant internal environment are taken into consideration. Some species have evolved the ability to regulate, but only over a limited range of environmental conditions, beyond which they simply conform. If the stressful external conditions are localised or remain only for a short duration, the organism has two other alternatives for survival. 2019-2020",1
719,250,"WAV ES 369 In solids, similar arguments can be made. In a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we can think of atoms in a lattice as end points, with springs between pairs of them. In the subsequent sections of this chapter we are going to discuss various characteristic properties of waves. 15.2 TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL WAVES We have seen that motion of mechanical waves involves oscillations of constituents of the medium. If the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a transverse wave. If they oscillate along the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a longitudinal wave. Fig.15.2 shows the propagation of a single pulse along a string, resulting from a single up and down jerk. If the string is very long compared Fig. 1 5.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a stretched string (x—direction), the elements of the string oscillate up and down (y— direction) to the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out before it reaches the other end and reﬂection from that end may be ignored. Fig. 15.3 shows a similar situation, but this time the external agent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up and down jerk to one end of the string. The resulting disturbance on the string is then a sinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of the string oscillate about their equilibrium mean Harmonic —> L x wave Fig. 1 5.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling along a stretched string is an example of a transverse wave. An element of the string in the region of the wave oscillates about its equilibrium position perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. position as the pulse or wave passes through them. The oscillations are normal to the direction of wave motion along the string, so this is an example of transverse wave. We can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix an instant of time and picture the wave in space. This will give us the shape of the wave as a whole in space at a given instant. Another way is to ﬁx a location i.e. fix our attention on a particular element of string and see its oscillatory motion in time. Fig. 15.4 describes the situation for longitudinal waves in the most familiar example of the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe filled with air has a piston at one end. A single sudden push forward and pull back of the piston will generate a pulse of condensations (higher density) and rarefactions (lower density) in the medium (air). If the push-pull of the piston is continuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a Fig. 1 5.4 Longitudinal waves (sound) generated in a pipe ﬁlled with air by moving the piston up and down.

The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system. The conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears it from foreign particles, humidiﬁes and also brings the air to body temperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and atmospheric air. The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically an air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by the vertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on the lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of lungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic cavity will be reﬂected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity. Such an arrangement is essential for breathing, as we cannot directly alter the pulmonary volume. Respiration involves the following steps: (1) Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air is drawn in and CO2 rich alveolar air is released out. (ii) Diffusion of gases (O2 and 002) across alveolar membrane. (iii) Transport of gases by the blood. (iv) Diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and tissues. (v) Utilisation of 02 by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant release of CO2 (cellular respiration as dealt in the Chapter 14). 17.2 MECHANISM OF BREATHING Breathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmospheric air is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out. The movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration can occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is less than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in the lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes place when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles — external and internal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients. Inspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The contraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the",1

How then is current established almost the instant a circuit is closed? (b) The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons in the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause acceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average drift speed? (c) If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron’s charge is small, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a conductor? ((1) When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential, does it mean that all the ‘free’ electrons of the metal are moving in the same direction? (e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive collisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of electric field, (ii) presence of electric field? Solution (a) Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly (with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electron drift. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons from one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However, it does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value. (b) Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until it collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed after collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed again only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average, therefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed. (c) Simple, because the electron number density is enormous, ~1029 m‘S. (d) By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large random velocities of electrons. (e) In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the presence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved. 3.5. 1 Mobility As we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In metals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they are electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be both positive and negative ions. An important quantity is the mobility ,u defined as the magnitude of the drift velocity per unit electric field: _|Vd| ” E (3.24) The SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practical units (cm2/Vs).

724,318,"spheres. When the separation between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges. However, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1 . 1)? Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will be q/ 2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/ 2, q/ 4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a ﬁxed pair of charges and measured the force for different separations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for different pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1). Coulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement, was initially experimentally arrived at in the manner described above. While the original experiments established it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been established down to subatomic level (r ~ 10‘10 m). Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round: Coulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), kis so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive value of k. The choice of k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the value of k is about 9 X 109 Nm2 C2 called a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we see that for q1=q2=1C,r=1m F: 9 x 109 N That is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance of 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum experiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude 9 X 109 N. One coulomb is evidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 “C. The constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as . The unit of charge that results from this choice is Electric Charges and Fields Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736 - 1806) Coulomb, a French physicist, began his career as a military engineer in the West Indies. In 1776, he returned to Paris and retired to a small estate to do his scientific research. He invented a torsion balance to measure the quantity of a force and used it for determination of forces of electric attraction or repulsion between small charged spheres. He thus arrived in 1785 at the inverse square law relation, now known as Coulomb’s law. The law had been anticipated by Priestley and also by Cavendish earlier, though Cavendish never published his results. Coulomb also found the inverse square law of force between unlike and like magnetic poles. k = 1 /47580 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s law is written as 1 |q1q2| 47:80 r2 F: (1.2) so is called the permittivity of free space .

Better awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically assisted deliveries and better post-natal care leading to decreased maternal and infant mortality rates, increased number of couples with small families, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical facilities for all sex-related problems, etc. all indicate improved reproductive health of the society. 4.2 POPULATION STABILISATION AND BIRTH CONTROL In the last century an all-round development in various ﬁelds signiﬁcantly improved the quality of life of the people. However, increased health facilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on the growth of population. The world population which was around 2 billion (2000 million) in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billion by 2000 and 7.2 billion in 201 1. A similar trend was observed in India too. Our population which was approximately 350 million at the time of our independence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed 1.2 billion in May 20 1 1. A rapid decline in death rate, maternal mortality rate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) as well as an increase in number of people in reproducible age are probable reasons for this. Through our Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programme, though we could bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal. According to the 201 1 census report, the population growth rate was less than 2 per cent, i.e., 20 / 1000 /year, a rate at which our population could increase rapidly. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an absolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and clothing, in spite of signiﬁcant progress made in those areas. Therefore, the government was forced to take up serious measures to check this population growth rate. The most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller families by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen advertisements in the media as well as posters / bills, etc., showing a happy couple with two children with a slogan Hum Do H amare Do (we two, our two). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even adopted an ‘one child norm’. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the female to 1 8 years and that of males to 2 1 years, and incentives given to couples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle this problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive methods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies. An ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available, effective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no way interfere with the sexual drive, desire and / or the sexual act of the user. Awide range of contraceptive methods are presently available which could be broadly grouped into the following categories, namely Natural/Traditional, Barrier, IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables, Implants and Surgical methods. 2019-2020",1

Also, the waste or harmful substances produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange these substances. More complex organisms use special ﬂuids Within their bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body ﬂuid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose. Another body ﬂuid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances. In this chapter, you Will learn about the composition and properties of blood and lymph (tissue ﬂuid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood is also explained herein. 18. l BLOOD Blood is a special connective tissue consisting of a ﬂuid matrix, plasma, and formed elements. 18. 1. 1 Plasma Plasma is a straw coloured, viscous ﬂuid constituting nearly 55 per cent of the blood. 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8 per cent of it.

The (dimensionless) ratio of the two forces shows that electrical forces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces.

The magnitude of displacement may or may not be equal to the path length traversed by an object. For example, for motion of the car from O to P, the path length is +360 m and the displacement is +360 m. In this case, the magnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to the path length (360 m). But consider the motion of the car from O to P and back to Q. In this case, the path length = (+360 m) + (+120 m) = + 480 m. However, the displacement = (+240 m) — (0 m) = + 240 m. Thus, the magnitude of displacement (240 m) is not equal to the path length (480 m).

The trend percentage is the percentage relationship, in which each item of different years bear to the same item in the base year. Trend analysis is important because, with its long run view, it may point to basic changes in the nature of the business.

731,626,"Chapter Eight ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES 8. 1 INTRODUCTION In Chapter 4, we learnt that an electric current produces magnetic ﬁeld and that two current-carrying wires exert a magnetic force on each other. Further, in Chapter 6, we have seen that a magnetic ﬁeld changing with time gives rise to an electric ﬁeld. Is the converse also true? Does an electric ﬁeld changing with time give rise to a magnetic ﬁeld? James Clerk Maxwell (1831- 1879), argued that this was indeed the case — not only an electric current but also a time-varying electric ﬁeld generates magnetic ﬁeld. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to ﬁnd magnetic ﬁeld at a point outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell noticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the existence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement current to remove this inconsistency. Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic fields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These equations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz force formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws of electromagnetism. The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time- varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds that propagate in space. The speed of the waves, according to these equations, turned out to be very close to 2019-20",0

The thymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins also increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The adrenal gland 1s composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer adrenal cortex.

Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean- shaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In grasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and size and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal apparatus (Figure 6.4). Epidermal cells Subsidiary cells Chloroplast Guard cells Stomatal pore Figure 6.4 Diagrammatic representation: (a) stomata with bean-shaped guard cells (b) stomata with dumb-bell shaped guard cell The cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are unicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and minerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called trichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular. They may be branched or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even be secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration. 6.2.2 The Ground Tissue System All tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground tissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex, pericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In leaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing cells and is called mesophyll. 2019-2020",1
734,125,"Electric Charges and Fields (iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called the Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and apply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without any bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a continuous charge distribution. (V) Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the electrostatic field when the system has some symmetry. This is facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface. (vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on distance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.

736,1496,The term greenhouse is derived from the analogy to a greenhouse used in cold areas for preserving heat. A greenhouse is made up of glass. The glass which is transparent to incoming short wave solar radiation is opaque to outgoing long wave radiation. The glass. therefore. allows in more radiation and prevents the long wave radiation going outside the glass house. causing the temperature inside the glasshouse structure warmer than outside. When you enter a car or a bus. during summers. where windows are closed. you feel more heat than outside. Likewise during winter the vehicles with closed doors and windows remain warmer than the temperature outside. This is another example of the greenhouse effect.,2

It has electrode wires that are maintained at several thousand volts, which produce a corona that releases electrons. These electrons attach to dust particles giving them a net negative charge. The collecting plates are grounded and attract the charged dust particles. The velocity of air between the plates must be low enough to allow the dust to fall.

It consists of two long straight wires of same length and equal radius suspended side by side from a fixed rigid support. The wire A (called the reference wire) carries a millimetre main scale M and a pan to place a weight. The wire B (called the experimental wire) of uniform area of cross- section also carries a pan in which known weights can be placed. A vernier scale V is attached to a pointer at the bottom of the experimental wire B, and the main scale M is fixed to the reference wire A. The weights placed in the pan exert a downward force and stretch the experimental wire under a tensile stress. The elongation of the wire (increase in length) is measured by the vernier arrangement. The reference wire is used to compensate for any change in length that may occur due to change in room temperature, since any change in length of the reference wire due to temperature change will be accompanied by an equal change in experimental wire. (We shall study these temperature effects in detail in Chapter 1 1.) Reference Wire Experimental Wire V M (Vernier Scale) (Metre Scale) Fig. 9.6 An arrangement for the determination of Young’s modulus of the material of a wire. Both the reference and experimental wires are given an initial small load to keep the wires straight and the vernier reading is noted. Now the experimental wire is gradually loaded with more weights to bring it under a tensile stress and the vernier reading is noted again. The difference between two vernier readings gives the elongation produced in the wire. Let r and L be the initial radius and length of the experimental wire, respectively. Then the area of cross-section of the wire would be n12. Let M be the mass that produced an elongation AL in the wire. Thus the applied force is equal to Mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. From Eq.

Thus, equipotential surfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred at the charge. Now the electric ﬁeld lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting from or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative. Clearly, the electric ﬁeld at every point is normal to the equipotential surface passing through that point. This is true in general: for any charge conﬁguration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the electric field at that point. The proof of this statement is simple. If the ﬁeld were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would have non-zero component along the surface.

We have already compared kinematics of the two motions. Also, we know that in rotational motion moment of inertia and torque play the same role as mass and force respectively in linear motion. Given this we should be able to guess what the other analogues indicated in the table are. For example, we know that in linear motion, work done is given by F dx, in rotational motion about a fixed axis it should be rdﬂ, since we already know the correspondence dx _> d0 and F _> 1- . It is, however, necessary that these correspondences are established on sound dynamical considerations. This is what we now turn to. Before we begin, we note a simpliﬁcation that arises in the case of rotational motion about a ﬁxed axis. Since the axis is fixed, only those components of torques, which are along the direction of the fixed axis need to be considered in our discussion. Only these components can cause the body to rotate about the axis. A component of the torque perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to turn the axis from its position. We specifically assume that there will arise necessary forces of constraint to cancel the effect of the perpendicular components of the (external) torques, so that the fixed position of the axis will be maintained. The perpendicular components of the torques, therefore need not be taken into account. This means that for our calculation of torques on a rigid body: (1) We need to consider only those forces that lie in planes perpendicular to the axis. Forces which are parallel to the axis will give torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account. (2) We need to consider only those components of the position vectors which are perpendicular to the axis. Components of position vectors along the axis will result in torques perpendicular to the axis and need not be taken into account.

Figure 7 .34 shows a cross-section of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken as the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the page; see Fig. 7.33). As said above we need to consider only those forces which lie in planes perpendicular to the axis.

Sieve tube elements are also long, tube-like structures, arranged longitudinally and are associated with the companion cells. Their end walls are perforated in a sieve-like manner to form the sieve plates. A mature sieve element possesses a peripheral cytoplasm and a large vacuole but lacks a nucleus. The functions of sieve tubes are controlled by the nucleus of companion cells. The companion cells are specialised parenchymatous cells, which are closely associated with sieve tube elements. The sieve tube elements and companion cells are connected by pit ﬁelds present between their common longitudinal walls. The companion cells help in maintaining the pressure gradient in the sieve tubes. Phloem parenchyma is made up of elongated, tapering cylindrical cells which have dense cytoplasm and nucleus. The cell wall is composed of cellulose and has pits through which plasmodesmatal connections exist between the cells. The phloem parenchyma stores food material and other substances like resins, latex and mucilage. Phloem parenchyma is absent in most of the monocotyledons. Phloem fibres (bast fibres) are made up of sclerenchymatous cells. These are generally absent in the primary phloem but are found in the secondary phloem. These are much elongated, unbranched and have pointed, needle like apices. The cell wall of phloem ﬁbres is quite thick. At maturity, these ﬁbres lose their protoplasm and become dead. Phloem ﬁbres of jute, ﬂax and hemp are used commercially. The ﬁrst formed primary phloem consists of narrow sieve tubes and is referred to as protophloem and the later formed phloem has bigger sieve tubes and is referred to as metaphloem. 6.2 THE TISSUE SYSTEM We were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present. Let us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the plant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on location.

These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or ﬁindamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system. 6.2. 1 Epidermal Tissue System The epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages — the trichomes and hairs.

Marconi’s experiment marks the beginning of the ﬁeld of communication using electromagnetic waves. 8.3.2 Nature of electromagnetic waves It can be shown from Maxwell’s equations that electric and magnetic ﬁelds in an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation.

The magnetic ﬁeld this gives rise to via the displacement current is along the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor plates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case.

In Fig. 8.4, we show a typical example of a plane electromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction (the ﬁelds are shown as a function of the z coordinate, at a given time t). The electric ﬁeld Ex is along the x—axis, and varies sinusoidally with 2, at a given time. The magnetic ﬁeld By is along the y-axis, and again varies sinusoidally with z.

749,248,"284 l Physics SUMMARY Maxwell found an inconsistency in the Ampere’s law and suggested the existence of an additional current, called displacement current, to remove this inconsistency. This displacement current is due to time—varying electric field and is given by 8d¢E i = — d 0 C1 t and acts as a source of magnetic field in exactly the same way as conduction current. An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric charge oscillating harmonically with frequency v, produces electromagnetic waves of the same frequency v. An electric dipole is a basic source of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres were first produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thus verified a basic prediction of Maxwell's equations. Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an electromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and B are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency v, wavelength A, propagating along z—direction, we have E =Ex(t] =E0sin[kz—cot) lznlé—wll=Eosml2n(%—%Jl B = By(t) = B0 sin [kz - a) t) = B0 sin [21:6 — vtj] = Bo “[24; _ 3] They are related by EO/B0 = c. The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to ,uo and so [the free space permeability and permittivity constants} as follows: c = 1/ Jﬂo £0 . The value of 0 equals the speed of light obtained from optical measurements. Light is an electromagnetic wave; 0 is, therefore, also the speed of light. Electromagnetic waves other than light also have the same velocity c in free space. The speed of light, or of electromagnetic waves in a material medium is given by v = l/Jﬂs where [.1 is the permeability of the medium and 8 its permittivity. Electromagnetic waves carry energy as they travel through space and this energy is shared equally by the electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves transport momentum as well. When these waves strike a surface, a pressure is exerted on the surface. If total energy transferred to a surface in time t is U, total momentum delivered to this surface is p = U/c. The spectrum of electromagnetic waves stretches, in principle, over an infinite range of wavelengths. Different regions are known by different 2019-20",0

Again consider the earth to be made up of concentric shells as before and a point mass m situated at a distance r from the centre. The point P lies outside the sphere of radius r. For the shells of radius greater than r, the point P lies inside. Hence according to result stated in the last section, they exert no gravitational force on mass m kept at P. The shells with radius 3 r make up a sphere of radius r for which the point P lies on the surface. This smaller sphere therefore exerts a force on a mass m at P as if its mass Mris concentrated at the centre. Thus the force on the mass m at P has a magnitude Gm (Mr) F = —2 (8.9) r We assume that the entire earth is of uniform 47; density and hence its mass is ME = g R: p where ME is the mass of the earth RE is its radius and p is the density.

Generally, order and other higher taxonomic categories are identiﬁed based on the aggregates of characters. Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of families which exhibit a few similar characters. The similar characters are less in number as compared to different genera included in a family. Plant families like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order Polymoniales mainly based on the ﬂoral characters. The animal order, Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae. 1.3.5 Class This category includes related orders. For example, order Primata comprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia along with order Carnivora that includes animals like tiger, cat and dog. Class Mammalia has other orders also. 1 .3.6 Phylum Classes comprising animals like ﬁshes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along with mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum. All these, based on the common features like presence of notochord and dorsal hollow neural system, are included in phylum Chordata. In case of plants, classes with a few similar characters are assigned to a higher category called Division. 1 .3.7 Kingdom All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the highest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification system of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is distinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions. Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and plant kingdoms. The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been shown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1. These are broad categories. However, taxonomists have also developed sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more sound and scientific placement of various taxa. Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1 . 1.

755,1437,"HOSZCHH CHAPTER ou have already learnt that the air i contains water vapour It varies from zero to four per cent by volume of the atmosphere and plays an important role in the weather phenomena. Water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely — gaseous, liquid and solid. The moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration. Thus, there is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation. Water vapour present in the air is known as humidity. It is expressed quantitatively in different ways. The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity. It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre. The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature. The absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth. The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity. With the change of air temperature, the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected. It is greater over the oceans and least over the continents. The air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be saturated. It means that the air at the given temperature is incapable of holding any additional amount of moisture at that stage. The temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air is known as dew point. WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE EVAPORATION AND CONDENSATION The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is added or withdrawn due to evaporation and condensation respectively. Evaporation is a process by which water is transformed from liquid to gaseous state. Heat is the main cause for evaporation. The temperature at which the water starts evaporating is referred to as the latent heat of vapourisation. Increase in temperature increases water absorption and retention capacity of the given parcel of air. Similarly, if the moisture content is low, air has a potentiality of absorbing and retaining moisture. Movement of air replaces the saturated layer with the unsaturated layer. Hence, the greater the movement of air, the greater is the evaporation. The transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation. Condensation is caused by the loss of heat. When moist air is cooled, it may reach a level when its capacity to hold water vapour ceases. Then, the excess water vapour condenses into liquid form. If it directly condenses into solid form, it is known as sublimation In free air, condensation results from cooling around very small particles termed as hygroscopic condensation nuclei. Particles of dust, smoke and salt from the ocean are particularly good nuclei because they absorb water. Condensation also takes place when the moist air comes in contact with some colder object and it may also take place when the temperature is close to the dew point. Condensation, therefore, depends upon the amount of cooling and the relative humidity of the air. Condensation is inﬂuenced by the volume of air, temperature, pressure and humidity. Condensation takes place: (i) when 2019-2020",2
756,1242,"BIOLOGY reproduction-related areas are currently in operation under the popular name ‘Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) programmes’. Creating awareness among people about various reproduction related aspects and providing facilities and support for building up a reproductively healthy society are the major tasks under these programmes. With the help of audio-Visual and the print-media governmental and non-governmental agencies have taken various steps to create awareness among the people about reproduction-related aspects. Parents, other close relatives, teachers and friends, also have a major role in the dissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education in schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to the young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and having misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information about reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS, etc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to lead a reproductively healthy life. Educating people, especially fertile couples and those in marriageable age group, about available birth control options, care of pregnant mothers, post-natal care of the mother and child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male and the female child, etc., would address the importance of bringing up socially conscious healthy families of desired size. Awareness of problems due to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and sex-related crimes, etc., need to be created to enable people to think and take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a socially responsible and healthy society. Successful implementation of various action plans to attain reproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional expertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical assistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like pregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems, infertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies from time to time are also required to provide more efficient care and assistance to people. Statutory ban on amniocentesis for sex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides, massive child immunisation, etc., are some programmes that merit mention in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic ﬂuid of the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved substances. This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain genetic disorders such as, down syndrome, haemoplilia, sickle-cell anemia, etc., determine the survivability of the foetus. Research on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and supported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out new methods and / or to improve upon the existing ones.

A material with large value of Young's modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in its length. In daily life. we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic. but it a is misnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered to be more elastic. In general. a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions also. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described by just one elastic constant. For example. for a wire under longitudinal strain, the lateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change. which is described by another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio). Stress is not a vector quantity since. unlike a force. the stress cannot be assigned a specific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a speciﬁed side of a section has a deﬁnite direction.

Such an error by definition is of clerical nature and most of the errors of commission affect in the trial balance. 6.4.3 Errors of Omission The errors of omission may be committed at the time of recording the transaction in the books of original entry or while posting to the ledger. These can be of two types: (i) error of complete omission (ii) error of partial omission When a transaction is completely omitted from recording in the books of original record, it is an error of complete omission. For example, credit sales to Mohan ? 10,000, not entered in the sales book. When the recording of transaction is partly omitted from the books, it is an error of partial omission. If in the above example, credit sales had been duly recorded in the sales book but the posting from sales book to Mohan’s account has not been made, it would be an error of partial omission. 6.4.4 Errors of Principle Accounting entries are recorded as per the generally accepted accounting principles. If any of these principles are violated or ignored, errors resulting from such Violation are known as errors of principle. An error of principle may occur due to incorrect classiﬁcation of expenditure or receipt between capital and revenue. This is very important because it will have an impact on financial statements. It may lead to under/ over stating of income or assets or liabilities, etc. For example, amount spent on additions to the buildings should be treated as capital expenditure and must be debited to the asset account. Instead, if this amount is debited to maintenance and repairs account, it has been treated as a revenue expense. This is an error of principle. Similarly, if a credit purchase of machinery is recorded in purchases book instead of j ournal proper or rent paid to the landlord is recorded in the cash book as payment to landlord, these errors of principle. These errors do not affect the trial balance. 6.4.5 Compensating Errors When two or more errors are committed in such a way that the net effect of these errors on the debits and credits of accounts is nil, such errors are called compensating errors.

In this case effectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus whose mass is less than the sum of the masses of the reactants. This mass difference, called the mass defect Am is the source of energy (Am)02. In fission, a heavy nucleus like uranium 25251}, is split by a neutron into lighter nuclei. Once again the final mass is less than the initial mass and the mass difference translates into energy, which can be tapped to provide electrical energy as in nuclear power plants (controlled nuclear ﬁssion) or can be employed in making nuclear weapons (uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion).

Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e. g. , adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing ﬂowers and fruits. The underground part of the ﬂowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1). 5.1 THE ROOT In majority of the dicotyledonous plants, the direct elongation of the radicle leads to the formation of primary root which grows inside the soil.

Further, EH = Eh which implies, v121= 29(H— h) (6.11 d) and is a familiar result from kinematics. At the height H, the energy is purely potential. It is partially converted to kinetic at height h and is fully kinetic at ground level. This illustrates the conservation of mechanical energy. b Example 6.7 Abob of mass mis suspended by a light string of length L. It is imparted a horizontal velocity no at the lowest point A such that it completes a semi-circular trajectory in the vertical plane with the string becoming slack only on reaching the topmost point.

Comment on the nature of the trajectory of the bob after it reaches the point C. 2019-20 Answer (i) There are two external forces on the bob : gravity and the tension (T) in the string. The latter does no work since the displacement of the bob is always normal to the string. The potential energy of the bob is thus associated with the gravitational force only. The total mechanical energy E of the system is conserved. We take the potential energy of the system to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus, at A : 1 E = Emvg (6.12) 2 ml) TA — mg = L0 [Newton’s Second Law] where TA is the tension in the string at A.

The Government of India has recently instituted the Amrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife Protection Award for individuals or communities from rural areas that have shown extraordinary courage and dedication in protecting wildlife. You may have heard of the Chipko Movement of Garhwal Himalayas. In 1974, local women showed enormous bravery in protecting trees from the axe of contractors by hugging them. People all over the world have acclaimed the Chipko movement. Realising the signiﬁcance of participation by local communities, the Government of India in 1980s has introduced the concept of Joint Forest Management (JFM) so as to work closely with the local communities for protecting and managing forests. In return for their services to the forest, the communities get beneﬁt of various forest products (e.g., fruits, gum, rubber, medicine, etc.), and thus the forest can be conserved in a sustainable manner. SUMMARY Major issues relating to environmental pollution and depletion of valuable natural resources vary in dimension from local, regional to global levels. Air pollution primarily results from burning of fossil fuel, e.g., coal and petroleum, in industries and in automobiles. They are harmful to humans, animals and plants, and therefore must be removed to keep our air clean. Domestic sewage, the most common source of pollution of water bodies, reduces dissolved oxygen but increases biochemical oxygen demand of receiving water. Domestic sewage is rich in nutrients, especially, nitrogen and phosphorus, which cause eutrophication and nuisance creating algal blooms. Industrial waste waters are often rich in toxic chemicals, especially heavy metals and organic compounds. Industrial waste waters harm living organisms. Municipal solid wastes also create problems and must be disposed off in landﬁlls. Disposal of hazardous wastes like defunct ships, radioactive wastes and e-wastes requires additional efforts. Soil pollution primarily results from agricultural chemicals (e. g., pesticides) and leachates from solid wastes deposited over it. Two major environmental issues of global nature are increasing greenhouse effect, which is warming Earth, and depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. Enhanced greenhouse effect is mainly due to increased emission of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs., and also due to deforestation.

The de Broglie wavelength (/1) associated with a moving particle is related to its momentum p as: 7» = h/ p. The dualism of matter is inherent in the de Broglie relation which contains a wave concept (/1) and a particle concept (p). The de Broglie wavelength is independent of the charge and nature of the material particle. It is signiﬁcantly measurable (of the order of the atomic-planes spacing in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles like electrons, protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence, momenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement, in case of macroscopic objects, commonly encountered in everyday life. Electron diffraction experiments by Davisson and Germer, and by G. P. Thomson, as well as many later experiments, have veriﬁed and conﬁrmed the wave-nature of electrons. The de Broglie hypothesis of matter waves supports the Bohr ’s concept of stationary orbits. Physical Symbol Dimensions Quantity POINTS TO PONDER Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the metal in a constant potential [This is only an approximation). They are not free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get out of the metal. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules in a gas jar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given temperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s distribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases. You will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do with the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the energy required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for different electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional energy to come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work function is the least energy required by an electron to come out of the metal. 2019-20",0

Have you ever wondered from where plants get their food? Green plants, in fact, have to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms depend on them for their needs. The green plants make or rather synthesise the food they need through photosynthesis and are therefore called autotrophs. You have already learnt that the autotrophic nutrition is found only in plants and all other organisms that depend on the green plants for food are heterotrophs. Green plants carry out ‘photosynthesis’, a physico-chemical process by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds. Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for energy. The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is the basis of life on earth. Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it is the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release of oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants. Have you ever thought what would happen if there were no oxygen to breath? This chapter focusses on the structure of the photosynthetic machinery and the various reactions that transform light energy into chemical energy. 13.1 WHAT DO WE KNOW? Let us try to ﬁnd out what we already know about photosynthesis. Some simple experiments you may have done in the earlier classes have shown that chlorophyll (green pigment of the leaf), light and CO2 are required for photosynthesis to occur. You may have carried out the experiment to look for starch formation in two leaves — a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with black paper, and exposed to light. On testing these leaves for the presence of starch it was clear that photosynthesis occurred only in the green parts of the leaves in the presence of light. 2019-2020",1
767,166,"UNITS AND MEASUREMENT test of consistency of units, but has the advantage that we need not commit ourselves to a particular choice of units, and we need not worry about conversions among multiples and sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in mind that if an equation fails this consistency test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be wrong. Example 2.1 5 Let us consider an equation 1 2 —mv =m h 2 9 where m is the mass of the body. L' its velocity. 9 is the acceleration due to gravity and It is the height. Check whether this equation is dimensionally correct.

Which of the formulae for kinetic energy (K) given below can you rule out on the basis of dimensional arguments (m stands for the mass of the body) : (a) K = m2 U"" (b) K =(1/2)mv'-' (c) K = ma ((1) K = (3/16)mv'~’ (e) K= (1/2)mv”+ ma Answer Every correct formula or equation must have the same dimensions on both sides of the equation. Also, only quantities with the same physical dimensions can be added or subtracted. The dimensions of the quantity on the right side are [M2 L3 T3] for (a); [M L2 T2] for 33 (b) and (d); [M LT2] for (c). The quantity on the right side of (c) has no proper dimensions since two quantities of different dimensions have been added. Since the kinetic energy K has the dimensions of [M L2 T2], formulas (a), (c) and (e) are ruled out. Note that dimensional arguments cannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the correct formula. For this, one must turn to the actual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter 6). The correct formula for kinetic energy is given by (b). 4 2.10.2 Deducing Relation among the Physical Quantities The method of dimensions can sometimes be used to deduce relation among the physical quantities. For this we should know the dependence of the physical quantity on other quantities (upto three physical quantities or linearly independent variables) and consider it as a product type of the dependence. Let us take an example. Example 2.1 7 Consider a simple pendulum. having 3 bob attached to a string. that oscillates under the action of the force of gravity. Suppose that the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum depends on its length (1). mass of the bob (m) and acceleration due to gravity (g). Derive the expression for its time period using method of dimensions. Answer The dependence of time period T on the quantities l, g and m as a product may be written as : T = k l"" 914 ml where k is dimensionless constant and x, y and z are the exponents.

768,1294,"BIOLOGY in temperate countries like Canada and Germany, snow leopards are not found in Kerala forests and tuna ﬁsh are rarely caught beyond tropical latitudes in the ocean. You can appreciate the signiﬁcance of temperature to living organisms when you realise that it affects the kinetics of enzymes and through it the metabolic activity and other physiological functions of the organism. A few organisms can tolerate and thrive in a wide range of temperatures (they are called eurythermal), but, a vast majority of them are restricted to a narrow range of temperatures (such organisms are called stenothermal). The levels of thermal tolerance of different species determine to a large extent their geographical distribution. Can you think of a few eurythermal and stenothermal animals and plants? In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the gradually increasing average global temperatures (Chapter 1 6). If this trend continues, would you expect the distributional range of some species to be affected? Water: Water is another the most important factor inﬂuencing the life of organisms. In fact, life on earth originated in water and is unsustainable without water. Its availability is so limited in deserts that only special adaptations make it possible for organisms to live there. The productivity and distribution of plants is also heavily dependent on water. You might think that organisms living in oceans, lakes and rivers should not face any water-related problems, but it is not true. For aquatic organisms the quality (chemical composition, pH) of water becomes important. The salt concentration (measured as salinity in parts per thousand), is less than 5 in inland waters, 30-35 in the sea and > 100 in some hypersaline lagoons. Some organisms are tolerant of a wide range of salinities (euryhaline) but others are restricted to a narrow range (stenohaline). Many freshwater animals cannot live for long in sea water and vice versa because of the osmotic problems, they would face. Light: Since plants produce food through photosynthesis, a process which is only possible when sunlight is available as a source of energy, we can quickly understand the importance of light for living organisms, particularly autotrophs. Many species of small plants (herbs and shrubs) growing in forests are adapted to photosynthesise optimally under very low light conditions because they are constantly overshadowed by tall, canopied trees. Many plants are also dependent on sunlight to meet their photoperiodic requirement for ﬂowering. For many animals too, light is important in that they use the diurnal and seasonal variations in light intensity and duration (photoperiod) as cues for timing their foraging, reproductive and migratory activities. The availability of light on land is closely linked with that of temperature since the sun is the source for both. But, deep (>500m) in the oceans, the environment is dark and its inhabitants are not aware of the existence of a celestial source of energy called Sun. What, then is their source of energy?. The spectral quality of solar radiation is also important for life.

The intercellular material of cartilage is solid and pliable and resists compression. Cells of this tissue (chondrocytes) are enclosed in small cavities within the matrix secreted by them (Figure 7 .6a). Most of the cartilages in vertebrate embryos are replaced by bones in adults. Cartilage is present in the tip of nose, outer ear joints, between adjacent bones of the vertebral column, limbs and hands in adults. Bones have a hard and non-pliable ground substance rich in calcium salts and collagen ﬁbres which give bone its strength Wigure 7 .6b). It is the main tissue that provides structural frame to the body. Bones support and protect softer tissues and organs. The bone cells (osteocytes) are present in the spaces called lacunae. Limb bones, such as the long bones of the legs, serve weight-bearing functions. They also interact with skeletal muscles attached to them to bring about movements. The bone marrow in some bones is the site of production of blood cells. Blood is a ﬂuid connective tissue containing plasma, red blood cells REC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (Figure 7.60). It is the main circulating ﬂuid that helps in the transport of various substances. You will learn more about blood in Chapters 17 and 18. 7. 1 .3 Muscle Tissue Each muscle is made of many long, cylindrical fibres arranged in parallel arrays. These ﬁbres are composed of numerous ﬁne ﬁbrils, called myofibrils. Muscle ﬁbres contract (shorten) in response to stimulation, then relax (lengthen) and return to their uncontracted state in a coordinated fashion. Their action moves the body to adjust to the changes in the environment and to maintain the positions of the various parts of the body. In general, muscles play an active role in all the movements of the body. Muscles are of three types, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle tissue is closely attached to skeletal bones. In a typical muscle such as the biceps, striated (striped) skeletal muscle ﬁbres are bundled together in a parallel fashion (Figure 7 .7 a). A sheath of tough connective tissue encloses several bundles of muscle ﬁbres (You will learn more about this in Chapter 20).",1
770,148,"Wave Optics DOES LIGHT TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT LINE? Light travels in a straight line in Class VI; it does not do so in Class XII and beyond! Surprised, aren’t you? In school, you are shown an experiment in which you take three cardboards with pinholes in them, place a candle on one side and look from the other side. If the ﬂame of the candle and the three pinholes are in a straight line, you can see the candle. Even if one of them is displaced a little, you cannot see the candle. This proves, so your teacher says, that light travels in a straight line. In the present book, there are two consecutive chapters, one on ray optics and the other on wave optics. Ray optics is based on rectilinear propagation of light, and deals with mirrors, lenses, reﬂection, refraction, etc. Then you come to the chapter on wave optics, and you are told that light travels as a wave, that it can bend around objects, it can diffract and interfere, etc. In optical region, light has a wavelength of about half a micrometre. If it encounters an obstacle of about this size, it can bend around it and can be seen on the other side. Thus a micrometre size obstacle will not be able to stop a light ray. If the obstacle is much larger, however, light will not be able to bend to that extent, and will not be seen on the other side. This is a property of a wave in general, and can be seen in sound waves too. The sound wave of our speech has a wavelength of about 50 cm to 1 m. If it meets an obstacle of the size of a few metres, it bends around it and reaches points behind the obstacle. But when it comes across a larger obstacle of a few hundred metres, such as a hillock, most of it is reﬂected and is heard as an echo. Then what about the primary school experiment? What happens there is that when we move any cardboard, the displacement is of the order of a few millimetres, which is much larger than the wavelength of light. Hence the candle cannot be seen. If we are able to move one of the cardboards by a micrometer or less, light will be able to diffract, and the candle will still be seen. One could add to the first sentence in this box: It learns how to bend as it grows up! 10.2 HUYGENS PRINCIPLE We would first define a wavefront: when we drop a small stone on a calm pool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every point on the surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a photograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the disturbance is maximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are oscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the source. Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a wavefront; thus a wavefront is deﬁned as a surface of constant phase. The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the source is called the speed of the FIGURE 10-1 (a) A wave.

We want to calculate the angular momentum of the particle about an arbitrary point 0. 0 Fig 7.19 The angular momentum is l = rX mv. Its magnitude is mvr sine, where 0 is the angle between 1' and v as shown in Fig. 7. 19. Although the particle changes position with time, the line of direction of v remains the same and hence OM = r sin 0. is a constant. Further, the direction of l is perpendicular to the plane of r and v. It is into the page of the figure.This direction does not change with time. Thus, 1 remains the same in magnitude and direction and is therefore conserved. Is there any external torque on the particle? 4 7.8 EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY We are now going to concentrate on the motion of rigid bodies rather than on the motion of general systems of particles. We shall recapitulate what effect the external forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth we shall omit the adjective ‘external’ because unless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only external forces and torques.) The forces change the translational state of the motion of the rigid body, i.e. they change its total linear momentum in accordance with Eq. (7.17). But this is not the only effect the forces have. The total torque on the body may not vanish. Such a torque changes the rotational state of motion of the rigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular momentum of the body in accordance with Eq. (7 .28 b). A rigid body is said to be in mechanical equilibrium, if both its linear momentum and angular momentum are not changing with time, or equivalently, the body has neither linear 2019-20 acceleration nor angular acceleration. This means (1) the total force, i.e. the vector sum of the forces, on the rigid body is zero; F1+F2+...+FH=ZFi=0 (7.30a) i=1 If the total force on the body is zero, then the total linear momentum of the body does not change with time. Eq. (7 .30a) gives the condition for the translational equilibrium of the body. (2) The total torque, i.e. the vector sum of the torques on the rigid body is zero, 121+152+...+‘Cn=z12i=0 (7.30b) i=1 If the total torque on the rigid body is zero, the total angular momentum of the body does not change with time. Eq. (7.30 b) gives the condition for the rotational equilibrium of the body. One may raise a question, whether the rotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7 .30(b)] remains valid, if the origin with respect to which the torques are taken is shifted. One can show that if the translational equilibrium condition [Eq. 7 .30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a shift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational equilibrium condition is independent of the location of the origin about which the torques are taken. Example 7.7 gives a proof of this result in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces acting on a rigid body in translational equilibrium. The generalisation of this result to n forces is left as an exercise. Eq. (7 .30a) and Eq. (7 .30b), both, are vector equations. They are equivalent to three scalar equations each. Eq. (7 .30a) corresponds to ;Fm=0, gmy=0 and gFiz=o (7.31a) where Fix, Fig and Fiz are respectively the x, y and 2 components of the forces Fi. Similarly, Eq.

775,1396,"188 wmv BIOLOGY demand of agricultural produce has contributed significantly to this pollution. Of course, we have now realised that there are problems associated with the overuse of chemical fertilisers and there is a large pressure to switch to organic farming — the use of biofertilisers. Biofertilisers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil. The main sources of biofertilisers are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria. You have studied about the nodules on the roots of leguminous plants formed by the symbiotic association of Rhizobium. These bacteria ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms, which is used by the plant as nutrient. Other bacteria can ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in the soil (examples Azospirillum and Azotobacter), thus enriching the nitrogen content of the soil. Fungi are also known to form symbiotic associations with plants (mycorrhiza). Many members of the genus Glomus form mycorrhiza. The fungal symbiont in these associations absorbs phosphorus from soil and passes it to the plant. Plants having such associations show other beneﬁts also, such as resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance to salinity and drought, and an overall increase in plant growth and development. Can you tell what advantage the fungus derives from this association? Cyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes widely distributed in aquatic and terrestrial environments many of which can ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen, e.g. Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, etc. In paddy ﬁelds, cyanobacteria serve as an important biofertiliser. Blue green algae also add organic matter to the soil and increase its fertility. Currently, in our country, a number of biofertilisers are available commercially in the market and farmers use these regularly in their ﬁelds to replenish soil nutrients and to reduce dependence on chemical fertilisers. SUMMARY Microbes are a very important component of life on earth. Not all microbes are pathogenic. Many microbes are very useful to human beings. We use microbes and microbially derived products almost every day. Bacteria called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk to convert it into curd. The dough, which is used to make bread, is fermented by yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Certain dishes such as idli and dosa, are made from dough fermented by microbes. Bacteria and fungi are used to impart particular texture, taste and ﬂavor to cheese. Microbes are used to produce industrial products like lactic acid, acetic acid and alcohol, which are used in a variety of processes in the industry. Antibiotics like penicillins produced by useful microbes are used to kill disease-causing harmful microbes. Antibiotics have played a major role in controlling infectious diseases like diphtheria, Whooping cough and 2019-2020",1

777,1030,"BIOLOGY grows by cell division. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs continuously throughout their life span. In animals, this growth is seen only up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs in certain tissues to replace lost cells. Unicellular organisms grow by cell division. One can easily observe this in in vitro cultures by simply counting the number of cells under the microscope. In majority of higher animals and plants, growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. One must remember that increase in body mass is considered as growth. Non-living objects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion for growth. Mountains, boulders and sand mounds do grow. However, this kind of growth exhibited by non-living objects is by accumulation of material on the surface. In living organisms, growth is from inside. Growth, therefore, cannot be taken as a deﬁning property of living organisms. Conditions under which it can be observed in all living organisms have to be explained and then we understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. A dead organism does not grow. Reproduction, likewise, is a characteristic of living organisms. In multicellular organisms, reproduction refers to the production of progeny possessing features more or less similar to those of parents. Invariably and implicitly we refer to sexual reproduction. Organisms reproduce by asexual means also. Fungi multiply and spread easily due to the millions of asexual spores they produce. In lower organisms like yeast and hydra, we observe budding. In Planaria (ﬂat worms), we observe true regeneration, i.e., a fragmented organism regenerates the lost part of its body and becomes, a new organism. The fungi, the ﬁlamentous algae, the protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it comes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba, reproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells. We have already deﬁned growth as equivalent to increase in cell number or mass. Hence, we notice that in single-celled organisms, we are not very clear about the usage of these two terms — growth and reproduction. Further, there are many organisms which do not reproduce (mules, sterile worker bees, infertile human couples, etc). Hence, reproduction also cannot be an all-inclusive deﬁning characteristic of living organisms. Of course, no non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself. Another characteristic of life is metabolism. All living organisms are made of chemicals. These chemicals, small and big, belonging to various classes, sizes, functions, etc., are constantly being made and changed into some other biomolecules. These conversions are chemical reactions or metabolic reactions. There are thousands of metabolic reactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they",1

In contrast light emitted from rarefied gases heated in a ﬂame, or excited electrically in a glow tube such as the familiar neon sign or mercury vapour light has only certain discrete wavelengths. The spectrum appears as a series of bright lines. In such gases, the average spacing between atoms is large. Hence, the radiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms rather than because of interactions between atoms or molecules. In the early nineteenth century it was also established that each element is associated with a characteristic spectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives a set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines. This fact suggested an intimate relationship between the internal structure of an atom and the spectrum of radiation emitted by it. In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer (1825 — 1898) obtained a simple empirical formula which gave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic hydrogen. Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements known, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this chapter. Ernst Rutherford (187 1—1937), a former research student of J . J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on oc—particles emitted by some radioactive elements. In 1906, he proposed a classic experiment of scattering of these oc-particles by atoms to investigate the atomic structure. This experiment was later performed around 19 l l by Hans Geiger (1 882—1 945) and Ernst Marsden (l 889— l 970, who was 20 year-old student and had not yet earned his bachelor’s degree). The details are discussed in Section 12.2. The explanation of the results led to the birth of Rutherford’s planetary model of atom (also called the nuclear model of the atom). According to this the entire positive charge and most of the mass of the atom is Ernst Rutherford [1871 - 1937) New Zealand born, British physicist who did pioneering ‘work on radioactive radiation. He discovered alpha-rays and beta-rays. Along with Federick Soddy, he created the modern theory of radioactivity. He studied the ‘emanation’ of thorium and discovered a new noble gas, an isotope of radon, now known as thoron. By scattering alpha-rays from the metal foils, he discovered the atomic nucleus and proposed the plenatery model of the atom. He also estimated the approximate size of the nucleus. concentrated in a small volume called the nucleus with electrons revolving around the nucleus just as planets revolve around the sun. Rutherford’s nuclear model was a major step towards how we see the atom today. However, it could not explain why atoms emit light of only discrete wavelengths. How could an atom as simple as hydrogen, consisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex spectrum of speciﬁc wavelengths? In the classical picture of an atom, the electron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves round the sun. However, we shall see that there are some serious difficulties in accepting such a model. 12.2 ALPHA-PARTICLE SCATTERING AND RUTHERFORD’S NUCLEAR MODEL OF ATOM At the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 19 l 1, H.

781,179,"i Physics Surface charge density a- lA>+++++++++++ geometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two conductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the insulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors] The SI unit of capacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt‘l) or 1 F = 1 C V‘l. A capacitor with fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as —| I—, while the one with variable capacitance is shown as ;Hﬁ. Equation (2.38) shows that for large C, Vis small for a given Q. This means a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge Q at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential difference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong electric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so produced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge on the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the capacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the intervening medium. The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand without break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric strength; for air it is about 3 X 106 Vm‘l. For a separation between conductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential difference of 3 X 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to store a large amount of charge without leaking, its capacitance should be high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric field do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit to the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without signiﬁcant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common units are its sub-multiples 1 11F = 1045 F, 1 nF = 10—9 F, 1 pF = 10—12 F, etc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most ac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7. 2. 12 THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR A parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting plates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the intervening medium between the plates to be 1 Area A vacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between ¢ the plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be the area of each plate and d the separation between them. The two plates have charges Q and —Q. Since dis much smaller than the linear dimension of the l i l j l plates (d2 << A), we can use the result on electric E charge density — 0' d field by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface charge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface charge density a = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface charge density —6. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric field in different regions is: Outer region I (region above the plate 1), FIGURE 2.25 The parallel plate capacitor. 74 0' 0' E = — —— = 0 2.90 2.90 (2'39) 2019-20",0

Nimbus clouds are shapeless masses of thick vapour. Figure 11.2 Identify these cloud types which are shown in Figure 11.1 and 11.2. A combination of these four basic types can give rise to the following types of clouds: high clouds — cirrus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus; middle clouds — altostratus and altocumulus; low clouds — stratocumulus and nimbostratus and clouds with extensive vertical development— cumulus and cumulonimbus. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Precipitation The process of continuous condensation in free air helps the condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall on to the earth’s surface. 80 after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation. This may take place in liquid or solid form. The precipitation in the form of water is called rainfall, when the temperature is lower than the DOC, precipitation takes place in the form of fine ﬂakes of snow and is called snowfall. Moisture is released in the form of hexagonal crystals. These crystals form ﬂakes of snow. Besides rain and snow, other forms of precipitation are sleet and hail, though the latter are limited in occurrence and are sporadic in both time and space. Sleet is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow-water. When a layer of air with the temperature above freezing point overlies a subfreezing layer near the ground, precipitation takes place in the form of sleet. Raindrops, which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below. As a result, they solidify and reach the ground as small pellets of ice not bigger than the raindrops from which they are formed. Sometimes, drops of rain after being released by the clouds become solidified into small rounded solid pieces of ice and which reach the surface of the earth are called hailstones. These are formed by the rainwater passing through the colder layers. Hailstones have several concentric layers of ice one over the other. Types of Rainfall On the basis of origin, rainfall may be classiﬁed into three main types — the convectional, orographic or relief and the cyclonic or frontal. Convectional Rain The, air on being heated, becomes light and rises up in convection currents. As it rises, it expands and loses heat and consequently, condensation takes place and cumulous clouds are formed. With thunder and lightening, heavy rainfall takes place but this does not last 2019-2020",2

784,1466,"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION ecosystems of which we are also a species. This fact must be drawn upon every one of us so that we live and let other species also live their lives. It is our ethical responsibility to consider that each and every species along with us have an intrinsic right to exist. Hence, it is morally wrong to voluntarily cause the extinction of any species. The level of biodiversity is a good indicator of the state of our relationships with other living species. In fact, the concept of biodiversity is an integral part of many human cultures. Loss OF BIODIVERSITY Since the last few decades, growth in human population has increased the rate of consumption of natural resources. It has accelerated the loss of species and habitation in different parts of the world. Tropical regions which occupy only about one-fourth of the total area of the world, contain about three- fourth of the world human population. Over- exploitation of resources and deforestation have become rampant to fulﬁl the needs of large population. As these tropical rain forests contain 50 per cent of the species on the earth, destruction of natural habitats have proved disastrous for the entire biosphere. Natural calamities such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, droughts, etc. cause damage to the ﬂora and fauna of the earth, bringing change the biodiversity of respective affected regions. Pesticides and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons and toxic heavy metals destroy the weak and sensitive species. Species which are not the natural inhabitants of the local habitat but are introduced into the system, are called exotic species. There are many examples when a natural biotic community of the ecosystem suffered extensive damage because of the introduction of exotic species. During the last few decades, some animals like tigers, elephants, rhinoceros, crocodiles, minks and birds were hunted mercilessly by poachers for their horn, tusks, hides, etc. It has resulted in the rendering of certain types of organisms as endangered category. 133 The International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has classified the threatened species of plants and animals into three categories for the purpose of their conservation. Endangered Species It includes those species which are in danger of extinction. The IUCN publishes information about endangered species world-wide as the Red List of threatened species. Figure 16.2 : Red Panda — an endangered species Vulnerable Species This includes the species which are likely to be in danger of extinction in near future if the factors threatening to their extinction continue. Survival of these species is not assured as their population has reduced greatly. Rare Species Population of these species is very small in the world; they are conﬁned to limited areas or thinly scattered over a wider area. CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY Biodiversity is important for human existence. All forms of life are so closely interlinked that disturbance in one gives rise to imbalance in the others. If species of plants and animals become endangered, they cause degradation in the environment, which may threaten human beings own existence. 2019-2020",2
785,282,"G RAVITATI ON 187 This clearly shows that the force due to earth’s gravity decreases with distance. If one assumes that the gravitational force due to the earth decreases in proportion to the inverse square of the distance from the centre of the earth, we will have am ocRr‘n2 ; g on R132 and we get —=— z 3600 (8.4) in agreement with a value of g : 9.8 m s2 and the value of aIn from Eq. (8.3). These observations led Newton to propose the following Universal Law of Gravitation : Every body in the universe attracts every other body with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The quotation is essentially from Newton’s famous treatise called ‘Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy’ (Principia for short). Stated Mathematically, Newton’s gravitation law reads : The force F on a point mass m2 due to another point mass m1 has the magnitude m1 m2 |F|=G r—2 (8.5) Equation (8.5) can be expressed in vector form as F: G ml—Zm2(—f-)=—G nil—2""“;- T 1‘ m1 m2 ‘ — r M3 where G is the universal gravitational constant, } is the unit vector from m1 to m2 and r = r2 — 1'1 as shown in Fig. 8.3. 2 Fig. 8.3 Gravitational force on m1 due to m2 is along r where the vector 1' is (r2— 1-1). The gravitational force is attractive, i.e., the force F is along — r. The force on point mass m1 due to m2 is of course — F by Newton’s third law. Thus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1 due to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to l are related as F12 = — F21. Before we can apply Eq. (8.5) to objects under consideration, we have to be careful since the law refers to point masses whereas we deal with extended objects which have finite size. Ifwe have a collection of point masses, the force on any one of them is the vector sum of the gravitational forces exerted by the other point masses as shown in Fig 8.4.

A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. There are two types of synapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical synapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very close proximity. Electrical current can ﬂow directly from one neuron into the other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across electrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single axon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster than that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our system. At a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons are separated by a ﬂuid-ﬁlled space called synaptic cleft (Figure 21.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an impulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic neuron? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the transmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain vesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action potential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the synaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma Axon Axon Neurotransmitters Figure 21.3 Diagram showing axon terminal and synapse 201 9-2020 terminal Synaptic vesicles Pre—synaptic membrane Synaptic cleft Post-synaptic membrane Receptors asdeuﬁs 319",1

The inheritance of ﬂower colour in the dog ﬂower (snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example to understand incomplete dominance. In a cross between true-breeding red-ﬂowered (RR) and true- breeding white-ﬂowered plants (rr), the F1 (Rr) was pink (Figure 5.6). When the F1 was self-pollinated the F2 resulted in the following ratio 1 (RR) Red : 2 (Rr) Pink: 1 (rr) White. Here the genotype ratios were exactly as we would expect in any mendelian monohybrid cross, but the phenotype ratios had changed from the 3: 1 dominant : recessive ratio. What happened was that R was not completely dominant over 1' and this made it possible to distinguish Rr as pink from RR (red) and rr (white) . Explanation of the concept of dominance: What exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles dominant and some recessive? To tackle these questions, we must understand what a gene does. Every gene, as you know by now, contains the information to express a particular trait. In a diploid organism, there are two copies of each gene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles need not always be identical, as in a heterozygote. One of them may be different due to some changes that it has undergone (about which you will read further on, and in the next chapter) which modiﬁes the information that particular allele contains. Let’s take an example of a gene that contains the information for producing an enzyme. Now there are two copies of this gene, the two allelic forms. Let us assume (as is more common) that the normal allele produces the normal enzyme that is needed for the transformation of a substrate S. Theoretically, the modiﬁed allele could be responsible for production of — (i) the normal/ less efﬁcient enzyme, or (ii) a non-functional enzyme, or (iii) no enzyme at all 2019-2020",1

The convention arose because the magnetic north was the direction to which the north pole of a magnetic needle pointed; the north pole of a magnet was so named as it was the north seeking pole.

The vertical plane containing the longitude circle and the axis of rotation of the earth is called the geographic meridian. In a similar way, one can deﬁne magnetic meridian of a place as the vertical plane which passes through the imaginary line joining the magnetic north and the south poles. This plane would intersect the surface of the earth in a longitude like circle. A magnetic needle, which is free to swing horizontally, would then lie in the magnetic meridian and the north pole of the needle would point towards the magnetic north pole. Since the line joining the magnetic poles is titled with respect to the geographic axis of the earth, the magnetic meridian at a point makes angle with the geographic meridian.

The Cell body axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body to a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction.

Different types of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion channels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not conducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is comparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K+) and nearly impermeable to sodium ions (Nat). Similarly, the membrane is impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm. Consequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration of K+ and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na“. In contrast, the ﬂuid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K‘”, a high concentration of Na+ and thus form a concentration gradient. These ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active transport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3 Na+ outwards for 2 K+ into the cell. As a result, the outer surface of the axonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface 317 Figure 21.1 Structure of a neuron",1

However, elementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic magnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents. 4. 10.3 The magnetic dipole moment of a revolving electron In Chapter 12 we shall read about the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom. You may perhaps have heard of this model which was proposed by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in l 9 1 l and was a stepping stone to a new kind of mechanics, namely, quantum mechanics. In the Bohr model, the electron (a negatively charged particle) revolves around a positively charged nucleus much as a planet revolves around the sun. The force in the former case is electrostatic (Coulomb force) while it is gravitational for ® the planet-Sun case.

Share Capital of a company is collected by issuing shares to either a select group of persons through the route of private placements and/ or offered to the public for subscription.

800,1353,"BIOLOGY gene gets ‘inactivated due to insertion’ of alien DNA, and helps in selection of recombinants. Selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a cumbersome procedure because it requires simultaneous plating on two plates having different antibiotics. Therefore, alternative selectable markers have been developed which differentiate recombinants from non-recombinants on the basis of their ability to produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. In this, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of an enzyme, |3-galactosidase. This results into inactivation of the gene for synthesis of this enzyme, which is referred to as insertional inactivation. The presence of a chromogenic substrate gives blue coloured colonies if the plasmid in the bacteria does not have an insert. Presence of insert results into insertional inactivation of the B-galactosidase gene and the colonies do not produce any colour, these are identified as recombinant colonies. (iv) Vectors for cloning genes in plants and animals : You may be surprised to know that we have learnt the lesson of transferring genes into plants and animals from bacteria and viruses which have known this for ages — how to deliver genes to transform eukaryotic cells and force them to do what the bacteria or viruses want. For example, Agrobacterium tumifaciens, a pathogen of several dicot plants is able to deliver a piece of DNA known as ‘T-DNA’ to transform normal plant cells into a tumor and direct these tumor cells to produce the chemicals required by the pathogen. Similarly, retroviruses in animals have the ability to transform normal cells into cancerous cells. A better understanding of the art of delivering genes by pathogens in their eukaryotic hosts has generated knowledge to transform these tools of pathogens into useful vectors for delivering genes of interest to humans. The tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid of Agrobacterium tumifaciens has now been modiﬁed into a cloning vector which is no more pathogenic to the plants but is still able to use the mechanisms to deliver genes of our interest into a variety of plants. Similarly, retroviruses have also been disarmed and are now used to deliver desirable genes into animal cells. So, once a gene or a DNA fragment has been ligated into a suitable vector it is transferred into a bacterial, plant or animal host (where it multiplies). 1 1 .2.3 Competent Host (For Transformation with Recombinant DNA) Since DNA is a hydrophilic molecule, it cannot pass through cell membranes. Why? In order to force bacteria to take up the plasmid, the bacterial cells must first be made ‘competent’ to take up DNA.

In this name Mangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species, or a speciﬁc epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows: 1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics. They are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin. 2. The ﬁrst word in a biological name represents the genus while the second component denotes the speciﬁc epithet. 3. Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are separately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin origin. 4. The ﬁrst word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter while the speciﬁc epithet starts with a small letter. It can be illustrated with the example of Mangifera indica. Name of the author appears after the speciﬁc epithet, i.e., at the end of the biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e. g., Mangﬁera indica Linn. It indicates that this species was ﬁrst described by Linnaeus. Since it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is necessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is classiﬁcation. Classiﬁcation is the process by which anything is grouped into convenient categories based on some easily observable characters. For example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or dogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate certain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you see when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’ and not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are talking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would, of course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, in plants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be of wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’, ‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient categories we use to study organisms. The scientiﬁc term for these categories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate categories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ — also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is also a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa — but you know that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels. Hence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classiﬁed into different taxa. This process of classiﬁcation is taxonomy.

In view of the high nutritive value of honey and its medicinal importance, there has been a remarkable growth in the practice of bee-keeping or apiculture. Fishery is another ﬂourishing industry meeting the ever-increasing demand for ﬁsh, fish products and other aquatic foods. Plant breeding may be used to create varieties, which are resistant to pathogens and to insect pests. This increases the yield of the food. This method has also been used to increase the protein content of the plant foods and thereby enhance the quality of food. In India, several varieties of different crop plants have been produced. All these measures enhance the production of food. Techniques of tissue culture and somatic hybridisation offer vast potential for manipulation of plants in vitro to produce new varieties. 10. 12.

Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these joints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classiﬁed into three major structural forms, namely, ﬁbrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Fibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of j oint is shown by the ﬂat skull bones which fuse end-to—end with the help of dense ﬁbrous connective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium. In cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with the help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements. Synovial joints are characterised by the presence of a ﬂuid ﬁlled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement allows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many other movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral girdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding joint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal of thumb) are some examples. 20.5 DISORDERS 0F MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEM Myasthenia gravis: Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular junction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle. Muscular dystrophy: Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly due to genetic disorder. Tetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca++ in body ﬂuid. Arthritis: Inﬂammation of j oints. Osteoporosis: Age-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass and increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a common cause. Gout: Inﬂammation of j oints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals. SUMMARY Movement is an essential feature of all living beings. Protoplasmic streaming, ciliary movements, movements of ﬁns, limbs, wings, etc., are some forms exhibited by animals. A voluntary movement which causes the animal to change its place, is",1

This has resulted in formation of a large area of thinned ozone layer, commonly called as the ozone hole (Figure 16.8). UV radiation of wavelengths shorter than UV-B, are almost completely absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, given that the ozone layer is intact. But, UV-B damages DNA and mutation may occur. It causes aging of skin, damage to skin cells and various types of skin cancers. In human eye, cornea absorbs UV—B radiation, and a high dose of UV—B causes inﬂammation of cornea, called snow-blindness, cataract, etc. Such exposure may permanently damage the cornea. Recognising the deleterious affects of ozone depletion, an international treaty, known as the Montreal Protocol, was signed at Montreal (Canada) in 1987 (effective in 1989) to control the emission of ozone depleting substances. Subsequently many more efforts have been made and protocols have laid down deﬁnite roadmaps, separately for developed and developing countries, for reducing the emission of CFCs and other ozone depleting chemicals. 16.8 DEGRADATION BY IMPROPER RESOURCE UTILISATION AND MAINTENANCE The degradation of natural resources can occur, not just by the action of pollutants but also by improper resource utilisation practices. Soil erosion and desertiﬁcation: The development of the fertile top-soil takes centuries. But, it can be removed very easily due to human activities like over-cultivation, unrestricted grazing, deforestation and poor irrigation practices, resulting in arid patches of land. When large barren patches extend and meet over time, a desert is created. Internationally, it has been recognised that desertiﬁcation is a major problem nowadays, particularly due to increased urbanisation. Waterlogging and soil salinity: Irrigation without proper drainage of water leads to waterlogging in the soil. Besides affecting the crops, waterlogging draws salt to the surface of the soil. The salt then is deposited as a thin crust on the land surface or starts collecting at the roots of the plants. This increased salt content is inimical to the growth of crops and is extremely damaging to agriculture. Waterlogging and soil salinity are some of the problems that have come in the wake of the Green Revolution. 16.9 DEFORESTATION Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested ones. According to an estimate, almost 40 per cent forests have been lost in the tropics, compared to only 1 per cent in the temperate region. The present scenario of deforestation is particularly grim in India. At the beginning of 2019—2020 283",1
809,1317,"EVOLUTION old — almost 20 billion years old. Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the universe. Galaxies contain stars and clouds of gas and dust. Considering the size of universe, earth is indeed a speck. The Big Bang theory attempts to explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion unimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the temperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later. The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the present day universe. In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back. There was no atmosphere on early earth. Water vapour, methane, carbondioxide and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface. The UV rays from the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter H2 escaped. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, CO2 and others. The ozone layer was formed. As it cooled, the water vapor fell as rain, to ﬁll all the depressions and form oceans. Life appeared 500 million years after the formation of earth, i.e., almost four billion years back. Did life come from outerspace? Some scientists believe that it came from outside. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called spores were transferred to different planets including earth. ‘Panspermia’ is still a favourite idea for some astronomers. For a long time it was also believed that life came out of decaying and rotting matter like straw, mud, etc. This was the theory of spontaneous generation. Louis Pasteur by careful experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life. He showed that in pre-sterilised ﬂasks, life did not come from killed yeast while in another ﬂask open to air, new living organisms arose from ‘killed yeast’. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all. However, this did not answer how the ﬁrst life form came on earth. Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the ﬁrst form of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules (e. g. RNA, protein, etc.) and that formation of life was preceded by chemical evolution, i.e., formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic constituents. The conditions on earth were — high temperature, volcanic storms, reducing atmosphere containing CH 4, NH3, etc. In 1953, S.L. Miller, an American scientist created similar conditions in a laboratory scale (Figure 7.1). He created electric discharge in a closed ﬂask containing CH 4, H2, NH3 and water vapour at 800°C. He observed formation of amino acids. In similar experiments others observed, formation of sugars, nitrogen bases, pigment and fats. Analysis of meteorite content also revealed similar compounds indicating that similar processes are occurring elsewhere in space. With this limited evidence, the ﬁrst part of the conjectured story, i.e., chemical evolution was more or less accepted. We have no idea about how the ﬁrst self replicating metabolic capsule of life arose. The ﬁrst non-cellular forms of life could have originated 3 billion years back. They would have been giant molecules (RNA, Protein, 2019-2020 I27",1
810,419,"l Physics interesting to note what Richard Feynman* has said in his famous Feynman Lectures on Physics: No one has ever been able to deﬁne the difference between interference and diffraction satisfactorily. It is just a question of usage, and there is no speciﬁc, important physical difference between them. The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to say that when there are only a few sources, say two interfering sources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there is a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is more often used. In the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the screen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit or hole, and the double-slit interference pattern. This is shown in Fig. 10.17. It shows a broader diffraction peak in which there appear several fringes of smaller width due to double-slit interference. The number of interference fringes occuring in the broad diffraction peak depends on the ratio d/ a, that is the ratio of the distance between the two slits to the width of a slit. In the limit of a becoming very small, the diffraction pattern will become very ﬂat and we will obsrve the two-slit interference pattern [see Fig. 10.13(b)]. 0 FIGURE 10.17 The actual double—slit interference pattern.

812,738,"440 l Physics atomic electrons is thus (—Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge of the nucleus is (+Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom is, therefore, exactly Z, the atomic number. Discovery of Neutron Since the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they must contain only one proton each. But the masses of the nuclei of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3. Therefore, the nuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain, in addition to a proton, some neutral matter. The amount of neutral matter present in the nuclei of these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately equal to one and two, respectively. This fact indicates that the nuclei of atoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a basic unit. This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick who observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were bombarded with alpha-particles (oz-particles are helium nuclei, to be discussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation could knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon and nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons (electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted of photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is available from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with a-particles. The clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to assume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral particles called neutrons. From conservation of energy and momentum, he was able to determine the mass of new particle ‘as very nearly the same as mass of proton’. The mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is mn = 1.00866 u = 1.6749X10‘27 kg (13.3) Chadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron. A free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable. It decays into a proton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and has a mean life of about 1000s. It is, however, stable inside the nucleus. The composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following terms and symbols: Z - atomic number = number of protons [13.4(a)] N - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)] A- mass number=Z+N = total number of protons and neutrons [13.4(c)] One also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the number of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A. Nuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation ‘Z‘X where X is the chemical symbol of the species. For example, the nucleus of gold is denoted by 1% Au. It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons and the restl 18 are neutrons. 2019-20",0

The American Institute of Certiﬁed Public Accountants states the nature of ﬁnancial statements as, “the statements prepared for the purpose of presenting a periodical review of report on progress by the management and deal with the status of investment in the business and the results achieved during the period under review. They reﬂect a combination of recorded facts, accounting principles and personal judgements"". The following points explain the nature of ﬁnancial statements: 1. Recorded Facts: Financial statements are prepared on the basis of facts in the form of cost data recorded in accounting books. The original cost or historical cost is the basis of recording transactions. The ﬁgures of various accounts such as cash in hand, cash at bank, trade receivables, ﬁxed assets, etc., are taken as per the ﬁgures recorded in the accounting books. The assets purchased at different times and at different prices are put together and shown at costs. As these are not based on market prices, the ﬁnancial statements do not show current ﬁnancial condition of the concern. Accounting Conventions: Certain accounting conventions are followed while preparing financial statements. The convention of valuing inventory at cost or market price, whichever is lower, is followed. The valuing of assets at cost less depreciation principle for balance sheet purposes is followed. The convention of materiality is followed in dealing with small items like pencils, pens, postage stamps, etc. These items are treated as expenditure in the year in which they are purchased even though they are assets in nature. The stationery is valued at cost and not on the principle of cost or market price, whichever is less. The use of accounting conventions makes ﬁnancial statements comparable, simple and realistic. Postulates: Financial statements are prepared on certain basic assumptions (pre-requisites) known as postulates such as going concern postulate, money measurement postulate, realisation postulate, etc. Going concern postulate assumes that the enterprise is treated as a going concern and exists for a longer period of time. So the assets are shown on historical cost basis. Money measurement postulate assumes that the value of money will remain the same in different periods. Though there is drastic change in purchasing power of money, the assets purchased at different times will be shown at the",3

We know that light waves can travel through vacuum. The light emitted by stars, which are hundreds of light years away, reaches us through inter-stellar space, which is practically a vacuum. The most familiar type of waves such as waves on a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves. These waves require a medium for propagation, they cannot propagate through vacuum. They involve oscillations of constituent particles and depend on the elastic properties of the medium. The electromagnetic waves that you will learn in Class XII are a different type of wave. Electromagnetic waves do not necessarily require a medium - they can travel through vacuum. Light, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic waves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves have the same speed c, whose value is : 0:299, 792, 458 HIS—1. (15.1) A third kind of wave is the so-called Matter waves. They are associated with constituents of matter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and molecules. They arise in quantum mechanical description of nature that you will learn in your later studies. Though conceptually more abstract than mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they have already found applications in several devices basic to modern technology; matter waves associated with electrons are employed in electron microscopes. In this chapter we will study mechanical waves, which require a material medium for their propagation. The aesthetic inﬂuence of waves on art and literature is seen from very early times; yet the first scientific analysis of wave motion dates back to the seventeenth century. Some of the famous scientists associated with the physics of wave motion are Christiaan Huygens (1629- 1695). Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The understanding of physics of waves followed the physics of oscillations of masses tied to springs and physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in elastic media are intimately connected with harmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled springs, air, etc., are examples of elastic media). 2019-20 We shall illustrate this connection through simple examples. Consider a collection of springs connected to one another as shown in Fig. 15.1. If the spring at one end is pulled suddenly and released, the disturbance travels to the other end. What has WWW Fig. 15.1 A collection of springs connected to each other. The end A is pulled suddenly generating a disturbance, which then propagates to the other end. happened? The first spring is disturbed from its equilibrium length. Since the second spring is connected to the first, it is also stretched or compressed, and so on. The disturbance moves from one end to the other; but each spring only executes small oscillations about its equilibrium position. As a practical example of this situation, consider a stationary train at a railway station. Different bogies of the train are coupled to each other through a spring coupling. When an engine is attached at one end, it gives a push to the bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from one bogie to another without the entire train being bodily displaced. Now let us consider the propagation of sound waves in air. As the wave passes through air, it compresses or expands a small region of air. This causes a change in the density of that region, say 6p, this change induces a change in pressure, 6p, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area, so there is a restoring force proportional to the disturbance, just like in a spring. In this case, the quantity similar to extension or compression of the spring is the change in density. If a region is compressed, the molecules in that region are packed together, and they tend to move out to the adjoining region, thereby increasing the density or creating compression in the adjoining region. Consequently, the air in the first region undergoes rarefaction. If a region is comparatively rarefied the surrounding air will rush in making the rarefaction move to the adjoining region. Thus, the compression or rarefaction moves from one region to another, making the propagation of a disturbance possible in air.",0

Carbon dioxide (C02) which is harmful is also released during the above catabolic reactions. It is, therefore, evident that 02 has to be continuously provided to the cells and CO2 produced by the cells have to be released out. This process of exchange of 02 from the atmosphere with CO2 produced by the cells is called breathing, commonly known as respiration. Place your hands on your chest; you can feel the chest moving up and down. You know that it is due to breathing. How do we breathe? The respiratory organs and the mechanism of breathing are described in the following sections of this chapter. 17.1 RESPIRATORY ORGANS Mechanisms of breathing vary among different groups of animals depending mainly on their habitats and levels of organisation. Lower invertebrates like sponges, coelenterates, ﬂatworms, etc., exchange 02 with CO2 by simple diffusion over their entire body surface. Earthworms use their moist cuticle and insects have a network of tubes (tracheal tubes) to transport atmospheric air within the body. Special vascularised structures called gills (branchial respiration) are used by most of the aquatic arthropods and molluscs whereas vascularised bags called lungs (pulmonary respiration) are used by the terrestrial forms for the exchange of gases. Among vertebrates, ﬁshes use gills whereas amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals respire through lungs. Amphibians like frogs can respire through their moist skin (cutaneous respiration) also. 2019-2020",1

821,128,"MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE POINTS TO PONDER l. 3.1 3.2 The path length traversed by an object between two points is. in general, not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points: the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. In one dimension. the two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases. the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. In view of point I above. the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement. velocity and acceleration. If a particle is speeding up. acceleration is in the direction of velocity: if its speed is decreasing. acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity. This statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle's speed is increasing or decreasing. The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice of the positive direction of the axis. For example. if the vertically upward direction is chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is negative. If a particle is falling under gravity. this acceleration. though negative. results in increase in speed. For a particle thrown upward. the same negative acceleration [of gravity) results in decrease in speed. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration at that instant. A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non—zero acceleration. For example. a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (3.1 1]]. the various quantities are algebraic, i.e. they may be positive or negative. The equations are applicable in all situations [for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration [Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5)] are exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations [Eq. [3. l 1]) are true only for motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during the course of motion.

The enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template. If the process of replication of DNA is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be ampliﬁed to approximately billion times, i.e., 1 billion copies are made. Such repeated ampliﬁcation is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA polymerase (isolated from a bacterium, Thermus aquaticus), which remain active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA. The ampliﬁed fragment if desired can now be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning (Figurel 1.6). 1 1.3.4 Insertion of Recombinant DNA into the Host Cell / Organism There are several methods of introducing the ligated DNA into recipient cells. Recipient cells after making them ‘competent’ to receive, take up DNA present in its surrounding. So, if a recombinant DNA bean'ng gene for resistance to an antibiotic (e. g., ampicillin) is transferred into E. coli cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells. If we spread the transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow, untransformed recipient cells will die. Since, due to ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the presence of ampicillin. ’Ihe ampicillin resistance gene in this case is called a selectable marker. 1 1.3.5 Obtaining the Foreign Gene Product When you insert a piece of alien DNA into a cloning vector and transfer it into a bacterial, plant or animal cell, the alien DNA gets multiplied. In almost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a desirable protein. Hence, there is a need for the recombinant DNA to be expressed. The foreign gene gets expressed under appropriate conditions. The expression of foreign genes in host cells involve understanding many technical details. After having cloned the gene of interest and having optimised the conditions to induce the expression of the target protein, one has to consider producing it on a large scale. Can you think of any reason why there is a need for large-scale production? If any protein encoding gene is expressed in a heterologous host, it is called a recombinant protein. The cells harbouring cloned genes of interest may be grown on a small scale in the laboratory. The cultures may be used for extracting the desired protein and then purifying it by using different separation techniques. The cells can also be multiplied in a continuous culture system wherein the used medium is drained out from one side while fresh medium is added from the other to maintain the cells in their physiologically most 2019—2020 203",1

You also lmow that in dicotyledonous plants and gymnosperms, the lateral meristems, vascular cambium and cork-cambium appear later in life. These are the meristems that cause the increase in the girth of the organs in which they are active. This is known as secondary growth of the plant (see Figure 15.2). 15. 1.2 Growth is Measurable Growth, at a cellular level, is principally a consequence of increase in the amount of protoplasm. Since increase in protoplasm is difficult to measure directly, one generally measures some quantity which is more or less proportional to it. Growth is, therefore, measured by a variety of parameters some of which are: increase in fresh weight, dry weight, length, area, volume and cell number. You may ﬁnd it amazing to know that one single maize root apical mersitem can give rise to more than 17,500 new cells per hour, whereas cells in a watermelon may increase in size by upto 3,50,000 times. In the former, growth is expressed as increase in cell number; the latter expresses growth as increase in size of the cell. While the growth of a pollen tube is measured in terms of its length, an increase in surface area denotes the grth in a dorsiventral leaf. 15. 1.3 Phases of Growth The period of growth is generally divided into three phases, namely, meristematic, elongation and maturation (Figure 1 5.3). Let us understand this by looking at the root tips. The constantly dividing cells, both at the root apex and the shoot apex, represent the meristematic phase of growth. The cells in this region are rich in protoplasm, possess large conspicuous nuclei. Their cell walls are primary in nature, thin and cellulosic with abundant plasmodesmatal connections.

828,747,"Duol Nature of Radiation and Moi-fer A photocell is a technological application of the photoelectric effect. It is a device whose electrical properties are affected by light. It is also sometimes called an electric eye. A photocell consists of a semi-cylindrical photo-sensitive metal plate C (emitter) and a wire loop A (collector) supported in an evacuated glass or quartz bulb. It is connected to the external circuit having a high-tension battery B and microammeter (uA) as shown in the Figure. Sometimes, instead of the plate C, a thin layer of photosensitive material is pasted on the inside of the bulb. A part of the bulb is left clean for the light to enter it. When light of suitable wavelength falls on the emitter C, photoelectrons are emitted. These photoelectrons are drawn to the collector A. Photocurrent of the order of a few microampere can be normally obtained from a photo cell. A photocell converts a change in intensity of illumination into a change in photocurrent. This current can be used to operate control systems and in light measuring devices. A photocell of lead sulphide sensitive to infrared radiation is used in electronic ignition circuits. In scientific work, photo cells are used whenever it is necessary to measure the intensity of light. Light meters in photographic cameras make use of photo cells to measure the intensity of incident light. The photocells, inserted in the door light electric circuit, are used as automatic door opener. A person approaching a doorway 0 ”A may interrupt a light beam which is incident on a photocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent may be used to start a motor which opens the door or rings an alarm. They are used in the control of a counting device which records every interruption of the light beam caused by a person or object passing across the beam. So photocells help count the persons entering an auditorium, provided they enter the hall one by one. They are used for detection of trafﬁc law defaulters: an alarm may be sounded whenever a beam of (invisible) radiation is intercepted. In burglar alarm, (invisible) ultraviolet light is continuously made to fall on a photocell installed at the doorway. A person entering the door interrupts the beam falling on the photocell. ’Ihe abrupt change in photocurrent is used to start an electric bell ringing. In ﬁre alarm, a number of photocells are installed at suitable places in a building. In the event of breaking out of fire, light radiations fall upon the photocell. This completes the electric circuit through an electric bell or a siren which starts operating as a warning signal. Photocells are used in the reproduction of sound in motion pictures and in the television camera for scanning and telecasting scenes.

Thus, a continuous ring of cambium is formed. 6.4.1.2 Activity of the cambial ring The cambial ring becomes active and begins to cut off new cells, both towards the inner and the outer sides. The cells cut off towards pith, mature into secondary xylem and the cells cut off towards periphery mature into secondary phloem. The cambium is generally more active on the inner side than on the outer. As a result, the amount of secondary xylem produced is more than secondary phloem and soon forms a compact mass. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually crushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary xylem. The primary xylem however remains more or less intact, in or around the centre. At some places, the cambium forms a narrow band of parenchyma, which passes through the secondary xylem and the secondary phloem in the radial directions.

This methodology has been practiced for more than a century now, in almost all parts of the world. Till date, no man- made technology has been able to rival the microbial treatment of sewage. You are aware that due to increasing urbanisation, sewage is being produced in much larger quantities than ever before. However the number of sewage treatment plants has not increased enough to treat such large quantities. So the untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to their pollution and increase in water-borne diseases. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated Ganga Action Plan and Yamuna Action Plan to save these major rivers of our country from pollution. Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number of sewage treatment plants so that only treated sewage may be discharged in the rivers. A visit to a sewage treatment plant situated in any place near you would be a very interesting and educating experience. 10.4 MICROBES IN PRODUCTION or BIOGAS Biogas is a mixture of gases (containing predominantly methane) produced by the microbial activity and which may be used as fuel. You have learnt that microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during growth and metabolism. The type of the gas produced depends upon the microbes and the organic substrates they utilise. In the examples cited in relation to fermentation of dough, cheese making and production of beverages, the main gas produced was C02. However, certain bacteria, which grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount of methane along with CO2 and H2. These bacteria are collectively called methanogens, and one such common bacterium is Methanobacterium. These bacteria are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during sewage treatment. These bacteria are also present in the rumen (a part of stomach) of cattle. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle is also present in the rumen. In rumen, these bacteria help in the breakdown of cellulose and play an important role in the nutrition of cattle. Do you think we, human beings, are able to digest the celluose present in our foods?Thus, the excreta (dung) of cattle, commonly called gobar, is rich in these bacteria. Dung can be used for generation of biogas, commonly called gobar gas. The biogas plant consists of a concrete tank (10- 15 feet deep) in which bio-wastes are collected and a slurry of dung is fed.

These cells also secrete modified polysaccharides, which accumulate between cells and fibres and act as matrix (ground substance). Connective tissues are classified into three types: (i) Loose connective tissue, (ii) Dense connective tissue and (iii) Specialised connective tissue. Loose connective tissue has cells and fibres loosely arranged in a semi-ﬂuid ground substance, for example, areolar tissue present beneath the skin (Figure 7.4).

832,726,"42 i Physics SUMMARY Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms, molecules and bulk matter. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is then negative. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile. Electric charge has three basic properties; quantisation, additivity and conservation. Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e., q = n e, where n = 0, 11, i2, 13, Proton and electron have charges +e, —e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large number, quantisation of charge can be ignored. Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs) of all individual charges in the system. Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge from one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge. Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point charges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them. Mathematically, k (qiq2) i. F21 = force on q2 due to (11 = r2 21 21 where £21 is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k = 41w 0 is the constant of proportionality.

If we separate a nucleus into its nucleons, we would have to supply a total energy equal to Eb, to those particles. Although we cannot tear apart a nucleus in this way, the nuclear binding energy is still a convenient measure of how well a nucleus is held together. A more useful measure of the binding between the constituents of the nucleus is the binding energy per nucleon, Eb”, which is the ratio of the binding energy Eb of a nucleus to the number of the nucleons, A, in that nucleus: E = Eb/A (13.9) bn We can think of binding energy per nucleon as the average energy per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons. Figure 13.1 is a plot of the binding energy per nucleon Elm versus the mass number A for a large number of nuclei.

(ii) E bn is lower for both light nuclei (A<30) and heavy nuclei (A> l 70). We can draw some conclusions from these two observations: (i) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding energy of a few MeV per nucleon. (ii) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a consequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged. Consider a particular nucleon inside a sufﬁciently large nucleus. It will be under the inﬂuence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the range of the nuclear force. If any other nucleon is at a distance more than the range of the nuclear force from the particular nucleon it will have no inﬂuence on the binding energy of the nucleon under consideration. If a nucleon can have a maximum of p neighbours within the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be proportional to p. Let the binding energy of the nucleus be pk, where k is a constant having the dimensions of energy. If we increase A by adding nucleons they will not change the binding energy of a nucleon inside. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it and not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon would be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is approximately equal to pk. The property that a given nucleon 2019-20",0

Domestic sewage primarily contains biodegradable organic matter, which readily decomposes — thanks to bacteria and other micro-organisms, which can multiply using these organic substances as substrates and hence utilise some of the components of sewage. It is possible to estimate the amount of biodegradable organic matter in sewage water by measuring Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Can you explain how? In the chapter on micro- organisms you have read about the relation between BOD, micro- organisms and the amount of biodegradable matter. Figure 16.3 shows some of the changes that one may notice following discharge of sewage into a river. Micro-organisms involved in biodegradation of organic matter in the receiving water body consume a lot of oxygen, and as a result there is a sharp decline in dissolved oxygen downstream from the point of sewage discharge. This causes mortality of fish and other aquatic creatures. Presence of large amounts of nutrients in waters also causes excessive growth of planktonic (free-ﬂoating) algae, called an algal bloom (Figure 16.4) which imparts a distinct colour to the water bodies. Algal blooms cause deterioration of the water quality and ﬁsh mortality. Some bloom-forming algae are extremely toxic to human beings and animals. You may have seen the beautiful mauve-colored ﬂowers found on very appealingly—shaped ﬂoating plants in water bodies. These plants which were introduced into India for their lovely ﬂowers have caused havoc by their excessive growth by causing blocks in our waterways. They grow faster than our ability to remove them. These are plants of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), the world’s most problematic aquatic weed, also Figure 16.4 Pictorial view of an algal bloom 2019—2020 275",1
837,1224,"158 BIOLOGY Concentration of Substrate With the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction rises at ﬁrst. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the substrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the substrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no free enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules (Figure 9.7). The activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of speciﬁc chemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical shuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition and the chemical is called an inhibitor. When the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as competitive inhibitor. Due to its close structural similarity with the substrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substrate- binding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and as a result, the enzyme action declines, e. g., inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate succinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the control of bacterial pathogens. 9. 12.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes Thousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most of these enzymes have been classiﬁed into different groups based on the type of reactions they catalyse. Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each with 4- 13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four-digit number.

838,447,"i Physics LIGHT SOURCES AND PHOTOMETRY It is known that a body above absolute zero temperature emits electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength region in which the body emits the radiation depends on its absolute temperature. Radiation emitted by a hot body, for example, a tungsten ﬁlament lamp having temperature 2850 K are partly invisible and mostly in infrared (or heat) region. As the temperature of the body increases radiation emitted by it is in visible region. The sun with temperature of about 5500 K emits radiation whose energy versus wavelength graph peaks approximately at 550 nm corresponding to green light and is almost in the middle of the visible region. The energy versus wavelength distribution graph for a given body peaks at some wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of that body. The measurement of light as perceived by human eye is called photometry. Photometry is measurement of a physiological phenomenon, being the stimulus of light as received by the human eye, transmitted by the optic nerves and analysed by the brain. The main physical quantities in photometry are (i) the luminous intensity of the source, (ii) the luminous ﬂux or flow of light from the source, and (iii) illuminance of the surface. The 81 unit of luminous intensity (I ) is candela (cd). The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 X 1012 Hz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1 / 683 watt per steradian. If a light source emits one candela of luminous intensity into a solid angle of one steradian, the total luminous ﬂux emitted into that solid angle is one lumen (lm). A standard 100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens. In photometry, the only parameter, which can be measured directly is illuminance. It is defined as luminous ﬂux incident per unit area on a surface (lm/m2 or lux). Most light meters measure this quantity. The illuminance E, produced by a source of luminous intensity I , is given by E = I / r2 , where r is the normal distance of the surface from the source. A quantity named luminance (L), is used to characterise the brightness of emitting or reﬂecting ﬂat surfaces. Its unit is cd/m2 (sometimes called ‘nit’ in industry). A good LCD computer monitor has a brightness of about 250 nits. Now, for ANOC, iis the exterior angle.

Plants need to move molecules over very long distances, much more than animals do; they also do not have a circulatory system in place. Water taken up by the roots has to reach all parts of the plant, up to the very tip of the growing stem. The photosynthates or food synthesised by the leaves have also to be moved to all parts including the root tips embedded deep inside the soil. Movement across short distances, say within the cell, across the membranes and from cell to cell within the tissue has also to take place. To understand some of the transport processes that take place in plants, one would have to recollect one’s basic knowledge about the structure of the cell and the anatomy of the plant body. We also need to revisit our understanding of diffusion, besides gaining some knowledge about chemical potential and ions. When we talk of the movement of substances we need first to define what kind of movement we are talking about, and also what substances we are looking at. In a ﬂowering plant the substances that would need to be transported are water, mineral nutrients, organic nutrients and plant growth regulators. Over small distances substances move by diffusion and by cytoplasmic streaming supplemented by active transport. Transport over longer distances proceeds through the vascular system (the xylem and the phloem) and is called translocation. An important aspect that needs to be considered is the direction of transport. In rooted plants, transport in xylem (of water and minerals) is essentially unidirectional, from roots to the stems. Organic and mineral nutrients however, undergo multidirectional transport. Organic 2019-2020",1

843,938,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS 187 rates, up to l 5 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A long standing question is, whether water is ‘pushed’ or ‘pulled’ through the plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly ‘pulled’ through the plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from the leaves. This is referred to as the cohesion-tension-transpiration pull model of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull? Water is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching the leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth. Most of it is lost through the stomata in the leaves. This water loss is known as transpiration. You have studied transpiration in an earlier class by enclosing a healthy plant in polythene bag and observing the droplets of water formed inside the bag. You could also study water loss from a leaf using cobalt chloride paper, which turns colour on absorbing water. 1 1 .4 TRANSPIRATION Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through these stomata. Normally stomata are open in the day time and close during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore or stomatal aperture, is thick and elastic. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells ﬂanking each stomatal aperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose rnicrofibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier for the stoma to open. When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss (or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard cells become ﬂaccid and the stoma closes. Usually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf has a greater number of stomata while in an isobilateral (often monocotyledonous) leaf they are about equal on both surfaces. Transpiration is affected by several external factors: temperature, light, MiCFOﬁbn'lS humidity, wind speed. Plant factors that Guard cell affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, per cent of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc. Stomatal aperture Figure11.8 A stomatal aperture with guard cells 2019-2020",1

Monera, Protista, Fungi, Animalia and Plantae. In this chapter, we will deal in detail with further classiﬁcation within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plant kingdom’. We must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom has changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protista having cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier classiﬁcations placed them in the same kingdom. So, the cyanobacteria that are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more. In this chapter, we will describe Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms under Plantae . Let us also look at classification within angiosperms to understand some of the concerns that inﬂuenced the classiﬁcation systems. The earliest systems of classiﬁcation used only gross superﬁcial morphological characters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc. They were based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androecium structure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were artiﬁcial; they separated the closely related species since they were based on a few characteristics. Also, the artiﬁcial systems gave equal weightage to vegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we know that often the vegetative characters are more easily affected by environment. As against this, natural classification systems developed, which were based on natural afﬁnities among the organisms and consider, 2019-2020",1

You can appreciate the signiﬁcance of temperature to living organisms when you realise that it affects the kinetics of enzymes and through it the metabolic activity and other physiological functions of the organism. A few organisms can tolerate and thrive in a wide range of temperatures (they are called eurythermal), but, a vast majority of them are restricted to a narrow range of temperatures (such organisms are called stenothermal). The levels of thermal tolerance of different species determine to a large extent their geographical distribution. Can you think of a few eurythermal and stenothermal animals and plants? In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the gradually increasing average global temperatures (Chapter 1 6). If this trend continues, would you expect the distributional range of some species to be affected? Water: Water is another the most important factor inﬂuencing the life of organisms. In fact, life on earth originated in water and is unsustainable without water. Its availability is so limited in deserts that only special adaptations make it possible for organisms to live there. The productivity and distribution of plants is also heavily dependent on water. You might think that organisms living in oceans, lakes and rivers should not face any water-related problems, but it is not true. For aquatic organisms the quality (chemical composition, pH) of water becomes important. The salt concentration (measured as salinity in parts per thousand), is less than 5 in inland waters, 30-35 in the sea and > 100 in some hypersaline lagoons. Some organisms are tolerant of a wide range of salinities (euryhaline) but others are restricted to a narrow range (stenohaline). Many freshwater animals cannot live for long in sea water and vice versa because of the osmotic problems, they would face. Light: Since plants produce food through photosynthesis, a process which is only possible when sunlight is available as a source of energy, we can quickly understand the importance of light for living organisms, particularly autotrophs. Many species of small plants (herbs and shrubs) growing in forests are adapted to photosynthesise optimally under very low light conditions because they are constantly overshadowed by tall, canopied trees. Many plants are also dependent on sunlight to meet their photoperiodic requirement for ﬂowering. For many animals too, light is important in that they use the diurnal and seasonal variations in light intensity and duration (photoperiod) as cues for timing their foraging, reproductive and migratory activities. The availability of light on land is closely linked with that of temperature since the sun is the source for both. But, deep (>500m) in the oceans, the environment is dark and its inhabitants are not aware of the existence of a celestial source of energy called Sun. What, then is their source of energy?.

The first amino acid is also called as N-terminal amino acid. The last amino acid is called the C- terminal amino acid. A protein thread does not exist throughout as an extended rigid rod. The thread is folded in the form of a helix (similar to a revolving staircase). Of course, only some portions of the protein thread are arranged in the form of a helix. In proteins, only right handed helices are observed. Other regions of the protein thread are folded into other forms in what is called the secondary structure. In addition, the long protein chain is also folded upon itself like a hollow woolen ball, giving rise to the tertiary structure (Figure 9.4 a, b). This gives us a 3- dimensional view of a protein. Tertiary structure is absolutely necessary for the many biological activities of proteins. Some proteins are an assembly of more than one polypeptide or subunits. The manner in which these individual folded polypeptides or subunits are arranged with respect to each other (e. g. linear string of spheres, spheres arranged one upon each other in the form of a cube or plate etc.) is the architecture of a protein otherwise called the quaternary structure of a protein. Adult human haemoglobin consists of 4 subunits. Two of these are identical to each other. Hence, two subunits of 0c type and two subunits of B type together constitute the human haemoglobin (Hb).",1

We restricted ourselves to simpler situations of rigid bodies. A rigid body generally means a hard solid object having a definite shape and size. But in reality, bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even the appreciably rigid steel bar can be deformed when a sufficiently large external force is applied on it. This means that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid. A solid has definite shape and size. In order to change (or deform) the shape or size of a body, a force is required. If you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the length of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape. The property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is known as elasticity and the deformation caused is known as elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their previous shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such substances are called plastic and this property is called plasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics. The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role in engineering design. For example, while designing a building, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel, concrete etc. is essential. The same is true in the design of bridges, automobiles, ropeways etc. One could also ask — Can we design an aeroplane which is very light but sufficiently strong? Can we design an artificial limb which is lighter but stronger? Why does a railway track have a particular shape like I? Why is glass brittle while brass is not? Answers to such questions begin with the study of how relatively simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform different solids bodies. In this chapter, we shall study the 2019-20",0
851,368,"4O i Physics EXAMPLE 1.13 The ﬂux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is E X 4 TE r2. However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no charge. Gauss’s law then gives E x 4 a: r2 = 0 i.e., E=O (r<R) (1.35) that is, the ﬁeld due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points inside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s law which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental veriﬁcation of this result confirms the l / r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law. Example 1.13 An early model for an atom considered it to have a positively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a uniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance r from the nucleus? FIGURE 1 .32 Solution The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as shown in Fig. 1.32. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical charge distribution of radius R must be —Z e, since the atom (nucleus of charge Z 6 + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us the negative charge density p, since we must have 3 41tR p=O-Ze __ 3Ze or ’0 41cR3 To find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away from the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric field E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the direction of r. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector 1' from the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a spherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations, namely, r < R and r > R. (i) r < R : The electric ﬂux g1) enclosed by the spherical surface is 4) = E (r) X 4 n r2 where E (r) is the magnitude of the electric field at r.

The de Broglie wavelength (/1) associated with a moving particle is related to its momentum p as: 7» = h/ p. The dualism of matter is inherent in the de Broglie relation which contains a wave concept (/1) and a particle concept (p). The de Broglie wavelength is independent of the charge and nature of the material particle. It is signiﬁcantly measurable (of the order of the atomic-planes spacing in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles like electrons, protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence, momenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement, in case of macroscopic objects, commonly encountered in everyday life. Electron diffraction experiments by Davisson and Germer, and by G. P. Thomson, as well as many later experiments, have veriﬁed and conﬁrmed the wave-nature of electrons. The de Broglie hypothesis of matter waves supports the Bohr ’s concept of stationary orbits. Physical Symbol Dimensions Quantity POINTS TO PONDER Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the metal in a constant potential [This is only an approximation). They are not free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get out of the metal. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules in a gas jar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given temperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s distribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases. You will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do with the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the energy required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for different electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional energy to come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work function is the least energy required by an electron to come out of the metal. 2019-20",0

The left plate of C1 and the right plate of C2 are connected to two terminals of a battery and have charges Q and —Q , respectively.

854,329,"372 l Physics In this experiment, the ﬁlament plays the role of the first slit 8 in Fig. 10.16. The lens of the eye focuses the pattern on the screen (the retina of the eye). With some effort, one can cut a double slit in an aluminium foil with a blade. The bulb filament can be viewed as before to repeat Young’s experiment. In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending a small angle at the eye. This is the reﬂection of the Sun in any shiny convex surface (e. g., a cycle bell). Do not try direct sunlight — it can damage the eye and will not give fringes anyway as the Sun subtends an angle of (1 / 2)°. In interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed. If it reduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another region, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy, which is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy. 10.6.3 Resolving power of optical instruments In Chapter 9 we had discussed about telescopes. The angular resolution of the telescope is determined by the objective of the telescope. The stars which are not resolved in the image produced by the objective cannot be resolved by any further magniﬁcation produced by the eyepiece. The primary purpose of the eyepiece is to provide magnification of the image produced by the objective. Consider a parallel beam of light falling on a convex lens. If the lens is well corrected for aberrations, then geometrical optics tells us that the beam will get focused to a point. However, because of diffraction, the beam instead of getting focused to a point gets focused to a spot of finite area. In this case the effects due to diffraction can be taken into account by considering a plane wave incident on a circular aperture followed by a convex lens (Fig. 10.19). The analysis of the corresponding diffraction pattern is quite involved; however, in principle, it is similar to the analysis carried out to obtain the single-slit diffraction pattern. Taking into account the effects due to diffraction, the pattern on the focal plane would consist of a central bright region surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings (Fig. 10. 19). A detailed analysis shows that the radius of the central bright region is approximately given by ~ 1.22/if _ 0.61/if 2a a l 2a l FIGURE 10.19 A parallel beam of light is incident on a convex lens.

Imagine a world where there is no electricity — no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and no personal computers. The pioneering experiments of Faraday and Henry have led directly to the development of modern day generators and transformers. Today’s civilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the discovery of electromagnetic induction. 6.2 THE EXPERIMENTS OF FARADAY AND HENRY The discovery and understanding of electromagnetic induction are based on a long series of experiments carried out by Faraday and Henry. We shall now describe some of these experiments. Went/went (ll Figure 6.1 shows a coil C1* connected to a galvanometer G. When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushed towards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deﬂects, indicating the presence of electric current in the coil. The deﬂection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion. The galvanometer does not show any deﬂection when the magnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled away from the coil, the galvanometer shows deﬂection in the opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the currents direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of the bar magnet is moved towards or away from the coil, the deﬂections in the galvanometer are opposite to that observed with the North-pole for similar movements. Further, the deﬂection (and hence current) is found to be larger when the magnet is pushed towards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead, when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C1 is moved towards or away from the magnet, the same effects are observed. It shows that it is the relative motion between the magnet and the coil that is responsible for generation (induction) of electric current in the coil. Experiment ()2 In Fig. 6.2 the bar magnet is replaced by a second coil C2 connected to a battery. The steady current in the coil C2 produces a steady magnetic field.

856,678,"OSCILLATIONS 359 swings is a good example of resonance. You might have realised that the skill in swinging to greater heights lies in the synchronisation of the rhythm of pushing against the ground with the natural frequency of the swing. To illustrate this point further, let us consider a set of five simple pendulums of assorted lengths suspended from a common rope as shown in Fig. 14.22. The pendulums 1 and 4 have the same lengths and the others have different lengths. Now, let us set pendulum 1 into motion. The energy from this pendulum gets transferred to other pendulums through the connecting rope and they start oscillating. The driving force is provided through the connecting rope. The frequency of this force is the frequency with which pendulum 1 oscillates. If we observe the response of pendulums 2, 3 and 5, they first start oscillating with their natural frequencies of oscillations and different amplitudes, but this 5 Fig. 14.22 Five simple pendulums of different lengths suspended from a common support. motion is gradually damped and not sustained. Their frequencies of oscillation gradually change, and ultimately, they oscillate with the frequency of pendulum 1, i.e., the frequency of the driving force but with different amplitudes. They oscillate with small amplitudes. The response of pendulum 4 is in contrast to this set of pendulums. It oscillates with the same frequency as that of pendulum 1 and its amplitude gradually picks up and becomes very large. A resonance-like response is seen. This happens because in this the condition for resonance is satisfied, i.e. the natural frequency of the system coincides with that of the driving force. We have so far considered oscillating systems which have just one natural frequency. In general, a system may have several natural frequencies. You will see examples of such systems (vibrating strings, air columns, etc.) in the next chapter. Any mechanical structure, like a building, a bridge, or an aircraft may have several possible natural frequencies. An external periodic force or disturbance will set the system in forced oscillation. If, accidentally, the forced frequency cod happens to be close to one of the natural frequencies of the system, the amplitude of oscillation will shoot up (resonance), resulting in possible damage. This is why, soldiers go out of step while crossing a bridge. For the same reason, an earthquake will not cause uniform damage to all buildings in an affected area, even if they are built with the same strength and material. The natural frequencies of a building depend on its height, other size parameters, and the nature of building material. The one with its natural frequency close to the frequency of seismic wave is likely to be damaged more. SUMMARY 1. The motion that repeats itself is called periodic motion. 2.

The two vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, so this method is also known as triangle method of vector addition. If we find the resultant of B + A as in Fig. 4.4(c), the same vector R is obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative: A+B=B+A (4.1) The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law as illustrated in Fig. 4.4(d). The result of adding vectors A and B first and then adding vector C is the same as the result of adding B and C first and then adding vector A : (A+B)+C=A+(B+C) (4.2) What is the result of adding two equal and opposite vectors ? Consider two vectors A and —A shown in Fig. 4.3(b). Their sum is A + (—A). Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the same, but the directions are opposite, the resultant vector has zero magnitude and is represented by 0 called a null vector or a zero vector : A—A=0 |0|=O (4.3) Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its direction cannot be specified. The null vector also results when we multiply a vector A by the number zero. The main properties of 0 are : A+0=A 7&0=0 OA=0 (4.4) (a) What is the physical meaning of a zero vector? Consider the position and displacement vectors in a plane as shown in Fig. 4. 1(a). Now suppose that an object which is at P at time t, moves to P’ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its displacement? Since the initial and final positions coincide, the displacement is a “null vector”. Subtraction of vectors can be defined in terms of addition of vectors. We define the difference of two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors A and —B : A— B = A + (—B) (4.5) It is shown in Fig 4.5. The vector —B is added to vectorA to get R2 = (A — B). The vector R1= A + B is also shown in the same figure for comparison. We can also use the parallelogram method to find the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have two vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we bring their tails to a common origin 0 as shown in Fig. 4.6(a). Then we draw a line from the head of A parallel to B and another line from the head of B parallel to A to complete a parallelogram OQSP. Now we join the point of the intersection of these two lines to the origin 0. The resultant vector R is directed from the common origin 0 along the diagonal (OS) of the parallelogram [Fig. 4.6(b)]. In Fig.4.6(c), the triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A and B and we see that the two methods yield the same result. Thus, the two methods are equivalent.

The RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). (ii) The second complexity is that the primary transcripts contain both the exons and the introns and are non-functional. Hence, it is subjected to a process called splicing where the introns are removed and exons are joined in a defined order. hnRNA undergoes additional processing called as capping and tailing. In capping an unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to the 5'—end of hnRNA. In tailing, adenylate residues (200-300) are added at 3'-end in a template independent manner. It is the fully processed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the nucleus for translation (Figure 6.1 1). The significance of such complexities is now beginning to be understood. The split— gene arrangements represent probably an ancient feature of the genome. The presence of introns is reminiscent of antiquity, and the process of splicing represents the dominance of RNA-world. In recent times, the understanding of RNA and RNA-dependent processes in the living system have assumed more importance. 6.6 GENETIC CODE During replication and transcription a nucleic acid was copied to form another nucleic acid. Hence, these processes are easy to conceptualise on the basis of complementarity. The process of translation requires transfer of genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides to synthesise a polymer of amino acids. Neither does any complementarity exist between nucleotides and amino acids, nor could any be drawn theoretically. There existed ample evidences, though, to support the notion that change in nucleic acids (genetic material) were responsible for change in amino acids in proteins. This led to the proposition of a genetic code that could direct the sequence of amino acids during synthesis of proteins. If determining the biochemical nature of genetic material and the structure of DNA was very exciting, the proposition and deciphering of genetic code were most challenging. In a very true sense, it required involvement of scientists from several disciplines — physicists, organic chemists, biochemists and geneticists. It was George Gamow, a physicist, who argued that since there are only 4 bases and if they have to code for 20 amino acids, the code should constitute a combination of bases. He suggested that in order to code for all the 20 amino acids, the code should be made up of three nucleotides. This was a very bold proposition, because a permutation combination of 43 (4 X 4 X 4) would generate 64 codons; generating many more codons than required. Providing proof that the codon was a triplet, was a more daunting task. The chemical method developed by Har Gobind Khorana was 2019-2020",1
862,1561,"160 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements Basis for ﬁscal policies:The ﬁscal policies, particularly taxation policies of the government, are related with the ﬁnancial performance of corporate undertakings. The ﬁnancial statements provide basic input for industrial, taxation and other economic policies of the government. Basis for granting of credit: Corporate undertakings have to borrow funds from banks and other ﬁnancial institutions for different purposes. Credit granting institutions take decisions based on the ﬁnancial performance of the undertakings. Thus, ﬁnancial statements form the basis for granting of credit. Basis for prospective investors: The investors include both short-term and long-term investors. Their prime considerations in their investment decisions are security and liquidity of their investment with reasonable profitability. Financial statements help the investors to assess long- term and short—term solvency as well as the proﬁtability of the concern. Guide to the value of the investment already made: Shareholders of companies are interested in knowing the status, safety and return on their investment. They may also need information to take decision about continuation or discontinuation of their investment in the business. Financial statements provide information to the shareholders in taking such important decisions. Aids trade associations in helping their members: Trade associations may analyse the ﬁnancial statements for the purpose of providing service and protection to their members. They may develop standard ratios and design uniform system of accounts. Helps stock exchanges: Financial statements help the stock exchanges to understand the extent of transparency in reporting on ﬁnancial performance and enables them to call for required information to protect the interest of investors. The ﬁnancial statements enable the Stock brokers to judge the ﬁnancial position of different concerns and take decisions about the prices to be quoted. 3.6 Limitations of Financial Statements Though utmost care is taken in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and provide detailed information to the users, they suffer from the following limitations: 1. Do not reﬂect current situation: Financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical cost. Since the purchasing power of money is changing, the values of assets and liabilities shown in ﬁnancial statement do not reﬂect current market situation. Assets may not realise: Accounting is done on the basis of certain conventions. Some of the assets may not realise the stated values, if",3

864,1426,"Roads Road transport is the most economical for short distances compared to railways. Freight transport by road is gaining importance because it offers door-to-door service. But unmetalled roads, though simple in construction, are not effective and serviceable for all seasons. During the rainy season these become unmotorable and even the metalled ones are seriously handicapped during heavy rains and ﬂoods. In such conditions, the high embankment of rail-tracks and the efﬁcient maintenance of railway transport service, is an effective solution. But the rail kilometrage being small cannot serve the needs of vast and developing countries at a low cost. Roads, therefore, play a vital role in a nation’s trade and commerce and for promoting tourism. The quality of the roads varies greatly between developed and developing countries because road construction and maintenance require heavy expenditure. In developed countries good quality roads are universal and provide long-distance links in the form of motorways, autobahns (Germany), and inter— state highways for speedy movement. Lorries, of increasing size and power to carry heavy loads, are common. But unfortunately, the world’s road system is not well developed. The world’s total motorable road length is only about 15 million km, of which North America accounts for 33 per cent. The highest road density and the highest number of vehicles are registered in this continent compared to Western Europe. Traffic Flows: Traffic on roads has increased dramatically in recent years. When the road network cannot cope with the demands of trafﬁc, congestion occurs. City roads suffer from chronic trafﬁc congestion. Peaks (high points) and troughs (low points) of trafﬁc ﬂow can be seen on roads at particular times of the day, for example, peaks occurring during the rush hour before and after work. Most of the cities in the world have been facing the problem of congestion. Think on these lines for a better tomorrow . . . URBAN TRANSPORT SOLUTIONS Higher Parking Fee Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Improved Public Bus Service Expressways Highways Highways are metalled roads connecting distant places. They are constructed in a manner for unobstructed vehicular movement. As such these are 80 m wide, with separate trafﬁc lanes, bridges, ﬂyovers and dual carriageways to facilitate uninterrupted trafﬁc ﬂow. In developed countries, every city and port town is linked through highways. Fig. 8.3 : Dharmavaram ’ﬂmi National Highway, India In North America, highway density is high, about 0.65 km per sq km.

Taking one end to be at x = O, the boundary conditions are that x = O and x = L are positions of nodes. The x = 0 condition is already satisfied. The x = L node condition requires that the length L is related to 7L by A L=n§; n=1,2,3,...

Gene therapy is an attempt to do this. Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/ embryo. Here genes are inserted into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a disease. Correction of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate for the non-functional gene. The ﬁrst clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deﬁciency. This enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function. The disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deﬁciency can be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection. But the problem with both of these approaches that they are not completely curative. As a ﬁrst step towards gene therapy, lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside the body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then introduced into these lymphocytes, which are subsequently returned to the patient. However, as these cells are not immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes. However, if the gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure. 2019—2020",1

(In fact, since you are aware that you are moving, these distant objects seem to move with you]. . 19 The principle of ‘parallax’ in section 2.3.1 is used in the determination of distances of very distant stars. The baseline AB is the line joining the Earth's two locations six months apart in its orbit around the Sun. That is, the baseline is about the diameter of the Earth’s orbit z 3 x 1011m. However, even the nearest stars are so distant that with such a long baseline, they show parallax only of the order of 1” (second) of arc or so. A parsec is a convenient unit of length on the astronomical scale.

They are re-formed into very small protein coated fat globules called the chylomicrons which are transported into the lymph vessels (lacteals) in the villi. These lymph vessels ultimately release the absorbed substances into the blood stream. Absorption of substances takes place in different parts of the alimentary canal, like mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. However, maximum absorption occurs in the small intestine. A summary of absorption (sites of absorption and substances absorbed) is given in Table 16.1. 265 TABLE 16.1 The Summary of Absorption in Different Parts of Digestive System Mouth Stomach Small Intestine Certain drugs Absorption of Principal organ for absorption coming in contact water, simple of nutrients.

The absorbed substances ﬁnally reach the tissues which utilise them for their activities. This process is called assimilation. The digestive wastes, solidified into coherent faeces in the rectum initiate a neural reﬂex causing an urge or desire for its removal. The egestion of faeces to the outside through the anal opening (defaecation) is a voluntary process and is carried out by a mass peristaltic movement. 16.4 DISORDERS 0F DIGESTIVE SYSTEM The inﬂammation of the intestinal tract is the most common ailment due to bacterial or viral infections. The infections are also caused by the parasites of the intestine like tapeworm, roundworm, threadworm, hookworm, pin worm, etc. Jaundice: The liver is affected, skin and eyes turn yellow due to the deposit of bile pigments. Vomiting: It is the ejection of stomach contents through the mouth. This reﬂex action is controlled by the vomit centre in the medulla. A feeling of nausea precedes vomiting. Diarrhoea: The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased liquidity of the faecal discharge is known as diarrhoea. It reduces the absorption of food. Constipation: In constipation, the faeces are retained within the colon as the bowel movements occur irregularly. Indigestion: In this condition, the food is not properly digested leading to a feeling of fullness. The causes of indigestion are inadequate enzyme secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, and spicy food. 2019-2020 Large Intestine Absorption of water, some minerals and drugs takes place.",1

The proximal end of the ﬁlament is attached to the thalamus or the petal of the ﬂower. The number and length of stamens are variable in ﬂowers of different species. If you were to collect a stamen each from ten ﬂowers (each from different species) and arrange them on a slide, you would be able to appreciate the large variation in size seen in nature. Careful observation of each stamen under a dissecting microscope and making neat diagrams would elucidate the range in shape and attachment of anthers in different ﬂowers. A typical angiosperm anther is bilobed with each lobe having two theca, i.e., they are dithecous (Figure 2.2 b). Often a longitudinal groove runs lengthwise separating the theca. Let us understand the various types of tissues and their organisation in the transverse section of an anther (Figure 2.3 a). The bilobed nature of an anther is very distinct in the transverse section of the anther.

HELICAL MOTION OF CHARGED PARTICLES AND AURORA BOREALIS In polar regions like Alaska and Northern Canada, a splendid display of colours is seen in the sky. The appearance of dancing green pink lights is fascinating, and equally puzzling. An explanation of this natural phenomenon is now found in physics, in terms of what we have studied here. Consider a charged particle of mass m and charge q, entering a region of magnetic ﬁeld B with an initial velocity v. Let this velocity have a component VP parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld and a component v11 normal to it. There is no force on a charged particle in the direction of the ﬁeld. Hence the particle continues to travel with the velocity VP parallel to the field. The normal component vn of the particle results in a Lorentz force (vn X B) which 1s perpendicular to both v11 and B. As seen in Section 4.3.1 the particle thus has a tendency to perform a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. When this is coupled With the velocity parallel to the ﬁeld, the resulting trajectory will be a helix along the magnetic field line, as shown in Figure (a) here. Even if the ﬁeld line bends, the helically moving particle is trapped and guided to move around the ﬁeld line. Since the Lorentz force is normal to the velocity of each point, the ﬁeld does no work on the particle and the magnitude of velocity remains the same. 8'? 31mg During a solar ﬂare, a large number of electrons and protons are ejected from the sun. Some of them get trapped in the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and move in helical paths along the ﬁeld lines. The ﬁeld lines come closer to each other near the magnetic poles; see ﬁgure (b). Hence the density of charges increases near the poles. These particles collide with atoms and molecules of the atmosphere. Excited oxygen atoms emit green light and excited nitrogen atoms emits pink light. This phenomenon is called Aurora Borealis in physics. 139 2019-20",0

The result was that 15N was incorporated into newly synthesised DNA (as well as other nitrogen containing compounds).

876,1032,"BIOLOGY SUMMARY Nucleic acids are long polymers of nucleotides. While DNA stores genetic information, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information. Though DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being chemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material. However, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA. The hallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen bonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that Adenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds, and Guanine with Cytosine through three H-bonds. This makes one strand complementary to the other. The DNA replicates semiconservatively, the process is guided by the complementary H-bonding. A segment of DNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as gene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a template to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA. In bacteria, the transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated. In eukaryotes, the gene is split. The coding sequences, exons, are interrupted by non-coding sequences, introns. Introns are removed and exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The messenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a combination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino acid. The genetic code is read again on the principle of complementarity by tRNA that acts as an adapter molecule. There are speciﬁc tRNAs for every amino acid. The tRNA binds to speciﬁc amino acid at one end and pairs through H-bonding with codes on mRNA through its anticodons. The site of translation (protein synthesis) is ribosomes, which bind to mRNA and provide platform for joining of amino acids. One of the rRNA acts as a catalyst for peptide bond formation, which is an example of RNA enzyme (ribozyme). Translation is a process that has evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since, transcription and translation are energetically very expensive processes, these have to be tightly regulated. Regulation of transcription is the primary step for regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, more than one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as operons. Lac operon is the prototype operon in bacteria, which codes for genes responsible for metabolism of lactose. The operon is regulated by the amount of lactose in the medium where the bacteria are grown. Therefore, this regulation can also be viewed as regulation of enzyme synthesis by its substrate. Human genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence every base in human genome. This project has yielded much new information. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a consequence of the project. DNA Fingerprinting is a technique to find out variations in individuals of a population at DNA level. It works on the principle of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It has immense applications in the field of forensic science, genetic biodiversity and evolutionary biology. § :<: 2019-2020",1

CHARGES m CLOUDS In olden days lightning was considered as an atmospheric ﬂash of supernatural origin. It was believed to be the great weapon of Gods. But today the phenomenon of lightning can be explained scientiﬁcally by elementary principles of physics. Atmospheric electricity arises due to the separation of electric charges. In the ionosphere and magnetosphere strong electric current is generated from the solar- terrestrial interaction. In the lower atmosphere, the current is weaker and is maintained by thunderstorm. There are ice particles in the clouds, which grow, collide, fracture and break apart. The smaller particles acquire positive charge and the larger ones negative charge. These charged particles get separated by updrifts in the clouds and gravity. The upper portion of the cloud becomes positively charged and the middle negatively charged, leading to dipole structure. Sometimes a very weak positive charge is found near the base of the cloud. The ground is positively charged at the time of thunderstorm development. Also, cosmic and radioactive radiations ionise air into positive and negative ions and the air becomes (weakly) electrically conductive. The separation of charges produce tremendous amount of electrical potential within the cloud, as well, as between the cloud and ground. This can amount to millions of volts and eventually the electrical resistance in the air breaks down and lightning ﬂash begins and thousands of amperes of current ﬂows. The electric field is of the order of 105 V/ m. A lightning ﬂash is composed of a series of strokes with an average of about four and the duration of each ﬂash is about 30 seconds. The average peak power per stroke is about 1012 watts. During fair weather also there is charge in the atmosphere. The fair weather electric field arises due to the em'stence of a surface charge density at ground and an atmospheric conductivity, as well as, due to the ﬂow of current from the ionosphere to the earth’s surface, which is of the order of picoampere / square metre. The surface charge density at ground is negative; the electric field is directed downward. Over land the average electric field is about 120 V/ m, which corresponds to a surface charge density of —1.2 X 10‘9 C / m2. Over the entire earth’s surface, the total negative charge amount to about 600 kC. An equal positive charge exists in the atmosphere. This electric field is not noticeable in daily life. The reason why it is not noticed is that virtually everything, including our bodies, is conductor compared to air. ‘ 111 2019-20",0

We have, of course, made assumptions that T and n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section, discuss the limitations of Ohm’s law. Example 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction electrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 X 10‘7 m2 carrying a current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly one conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 X 103 kg/m3, and its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained above with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary temperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the conductor which causes the drift motion. Solution (a) (b) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite to the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction of increasing potential. The drift speed vd is given by Eq. (3.18) vd = (I/neA) Now, e = 1.6 x 10‘19 c, A = 1.0 x 10‘7m2, I = 1.5 A. The density of conduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic metre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is reasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre of copper has a mass of 9.0 X 103 kg. Since 6.0 X 1023 copper atoms have a mass of 63.5 g, 6.0 x 1023 n = — 63.5 = 8.5 x 1028 m""3 x 9.0 x 106 which gives, 1.5 U = d 8.5x1o28 ><1.6><1o-19 xl.0><10'7 = 1.1 X 10‘3ms‘1 = 1.1 mm s‘1 (i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed“ of a copper atom of mass M is obtained from [<(1/2) Mv2 > = (3/2) kBT) and is thus typically of the order of \lkBT/M , where (:5 is the Boltzmann constant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 X 102 m/s. This figure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms in a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much smaller, about 10‘5 times the typical thermal speed at ordinary temperatures. (ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of an electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 X 108 m s‘1 (You will learn about this in Chapter 8).

This happens because the primary accepter of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier. Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane. (c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP’“ to NADPH+ H’“. These protons are also removed from the stroma. Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons. This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable decrease in pH in the lumen. Why are we so interested in the proton gradient? This gradient is important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the synthesis of ATP. The gradient is broken down due to the movement of protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane",1
885,829,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS 1 1.4. 1 Transpiration and Photosynthesis — a Compromise Transpiration has more than one purpose; it ° creates transpiration pull for absorption and transport of plants ' supplies water for photosynthesis ° transports minerals from the soil to all parts of the plant ° cools leaf surfaces, sometimes 10 to 15 degrees, by evaporative cooling ' maintains the shape and structure of the plants by keeping cells turgid An actively photosynthesising plant has an insatiable need for water. Photosynthesis is limited by available water which can be swiftly depleted by transpiration. The humidity of rainforests is largely due to this vast cycling of water from root to leaf to atmosphere and back to the soil. The evolution of the C 4 photosynthetic system is probably one of the strategies for maximising the availability of CO2 while minimising water loss. C 4 plants are twice as efficient as C3 plants in terms of ﬁxing carbon dioxide (making sugar). However, a C 4 plant loses only half as much water as a C3 plant for the same amount of CO2 ﬁxed. 1 1.5 UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT 0F MINERAL NUTRIENTS Plants obtain their carbon and most of their oxygen from CO2 in the atmosphere. However, their remaining nutritional requirements are obtained from water and minerals in the soil. 1 1.5. 1 Uptake of Mineral Ions Unlike water, all minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors account for this: (i) minerals are present in the soil as charged particles (ions) which cannot move across cell membranes and (ii) the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals must enter the root by active absorption into the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy in the form of ATP. The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the water potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by osmosis. Some ions also move into the epidermal cells passively. Ions are absorbed from the soil by both passive and active transport. Speciﬁc proteins in the membranes of root hair cells actively pump ions from the soil into the cytoplasms of the epidermal cells. Like all cells, the endodermal cells have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma membrane; they let some solutes cross the membrane, but not others. Transport proteins of endodermal cells are control points, where a plant adjusts the quantity and types of solutes that reach the xylem Note that the root endodermis because of the layer of suberin has the ability to actively transport ions in one direction only. 189",1

A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which was based on the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method involves silencing of a speciﬁc mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing). The source of this complementary RNA could be from an infection by Viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons) that replicate via an RNA intermediate. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant (Figure 12.2). The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host cells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double stranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced the speciﬁc mRNA 2019—2020",1

The most common of these structures are zoospores that usually are microscopic motile structures. Other common asexual reproductive structures are conidia (Penicillium), buds (Hydra) and gemmules (sponge). You have learnt about vegetative reproduction in plants in Class XI. What do you think — Is vegetative reproduction also a type of asexual reproduction? Why do you say so? Is the term clone applicable to the offspring formed by vegetative reproduction? While in animals and other simple organisms the term asexual is used unambiguously, in plants, the term vegetative reproduction is frequently used. In plants, the units of vegetative propagation such as runner, rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new offspring (Figure 1.4). These structures are called vegetative propagules. 2019—2020",1
891,1181,"184 Plasmodesmata Epidermis BIOLOGY The bulk movement of substances through the conducting or vascular tissues of plants is called translocation. Do you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves of higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants have highly specialised vascular tissues — xylem and phloem. Xylem is associated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic nitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The phloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly from the leaves to other parts of the plants. 1 1.3. 1 How do Plants Absorb Water? We know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants; obviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves. The responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more speciﬁcally the function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the roots. Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal cells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion. Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root layers by two distinct pathways: ' apoplast pathway ' symplast pathway The apoplast is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous throughout the plant, except at the casparian strips of the endodermis in the roots (Figure 1 1.6). The apoplastic movement of water occurs exclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells. Movement through the apoplast does not involve crossing the cell Plasma membrane ’ .

Let us study the pathway by listing the steps. The primary CO2 acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme responsible for this ﬁxation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C 4 acid OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells. It then forms other 4—carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle sheath cells. In the bundle sheath cells these C 4 acids are broken down to release CO2 and a 3-carbon molecule. The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle. The CO2 released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C3 or the Calvin pathway, a pathway common to all plants.

893,617,"94 PHYSICS this hurts.The conclusion is clear: force not only depends on the change in momentum, but also on how fast the change is brought about. The same change in momentum brought about in a shorter time needs a greater applied force. In short, the greater the rate of change of momentum, the greater is the force. Fig. 5.3 Force not only depends on the change in momentum but also on how fast the change is brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws in his hands during a catch, allowing greater time for the ball to stop and hence requires a smaller force. ' Observations confirm that the product of mass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to the effect of force on motion. Suppose a fixed force is applied for a certain interval of time on two bodies of different masses, initially at rest, the lighter body picks up a greater speed than the heavier body. However, at the end of the time interval, observations show that each body acquires the same momentum. Thus the same force for the same time causes the same change in momentum for different bodies. This is a crucial clue to the second law of motion. ' In the preceding observations, the vector character of momentum has not been evident. In the examples so far, momentum and change in momentum both have the same direction. But this is not always the case. Suppose a stone is rotated with uniform speed in a horizontal plane by means of a string, the magnitude of momentum is fixed, but its direction changes (Fig. 5.4). A force is needed to cause this change in momentum vector. 2019-20 This force is provided by our hand through the string. Experience suggests that our hand needs to exert a greater force if the stone is rotated at greater speed or in a circle of smaller radius, or both. This corresponds to greater acceleration or equivalently a greater rate of change in momentum vector. This suggests that the greater the rate of change in momentum vector the greater is the force applied. Fig. 5.4 Force is necessary for changing the direction of momentum, even if its magnitude is constant. We can feel this while rotating a stone in a horizontal circle with unifomi speed by means of a string. These qualitative observations lead to the second law of motion expressed by Newton as follows: The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus, if under the action of a force F for time interval At, the velocity of a body of mass m changes from v to v + Av i.e. its initial momentum p = m v changes by Ap = mAv . According to the Second Law, Focﬂ or F =kA—P At At where k is a constant of proportionality. Taking the limit At —> O, the term ﬂ becomes the At derivative or differential co-efficient of p with respect to t, denoted by % . Thus",0
894,893,"170 BIOLOGY Fisheries has an important place in Indian economy. It provides income and employment to millions of ﬁshermen and farmers, particularly in the coastal states. For many, it is the only source of their livelihood. In order to meet the increasing demands on ﬁsheries, different techniques have been employed to increase production. For example, through aquaculture and pisciculture we have been able to increase the production of aquatic plants and animals, both fresh-water and marine. Find out the difference between pisciculture and aquaculture. This has led to the development and ﬂourishing of the ﬁshery industry, and it has brought a lot of income to the farmers in particular and the country in general. We now talk about ‘Blue Revolution’ as being implemented along the same lines as ‘Green Revolution’. 9.2 PLANT BREEDING Traditional farming can only yield a limited biomass, as food for humans and animals. Better management practices and increase in acreage can increase yield, but only to a limited extent. Plant breeding as a technology has helped increase yields to a very large extent. Who in India has not heard of Green Revolution which was responsible for our country to not merely meet the national requirements in food production but also helped us even to export it? Green revolution was dependent to a large extent on plant breeding techniques for development of high-yielding and disease resistant varieties in wheat, rice, maize, etc. 9.2. 1 What is Plant Breeding? Plant breeding is the purposeful manipulation of plant species in order to create desired plant types that are better suited for cultivation, give better yields and are disease resistant. Conventional plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since the beginning of human civilisation; recorded evidence of plant breeding dates back to 9,000- 1 1,000 years ago. Many present-day crops are the result of domestication in ancient times. Today, all our major food crops are derived from domesticated varieties. Classical plant breeding involves crossing or hybridisation of pure lines, followed by artiﬁcial selection to produce plants with desirable traits of higher yield, nutrition and resistance to diseases. With advancements in genetics, molecular biology and tissue culture, plant breeding is now increasingly being carried out by using molecular genetic tools. If we were to list the traits or characters that the breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants, the ﬁrst we would list would be increased crop yield and improved quality. Increased tolerance to environmental stresses (salinity, extreme temperatures, drought), resistance to pathogens (viruses, fungi and bacteria) and increased tolerance to insect pests would be on our list too. 2019—2020",1

The figure shows a planar body. An axis perpendicular to the body through a point 0 is taken as the z—axis. Two mutually perpendicular axes lying in the plane of the body and concurrent with z—axis, i.e., passing through 0, are taken as the x and y-axes. The theorem states that [Z = IX + 1y (7.36) Let us look at the usefulness of the theorem through an example. > Example 7.10 What is the moment of inertia of a disc about one of its diameters? Fig. 7.30 Moment of inertia of a disc about a diameter, given its moment of inertia about the perpendicular axis through its centre. 2019-20 Answer We assume the moment of inertia of the disc about an axis perpendicular to it and through its centre to be known; it is MR2/ 2, where M is the mass of the disc and R is its radius (Table 7.1) The disc can be considered to be a planar body. Hence the theorem of perpendicular axes is applicable to it. As shown in Fig. 7 .30, we take three concurrent axes through the centre of the disc, 0, as the x—, y— and z—axes; x— and y—axes lie in the plane of the disc and z—axis is perpendicular to it. By the theorem of perpendicular axes, IZ=IX+Iy Now, x and y axes are along two diameters of the disc, and by symmetry the moment of inertia of the disc is the same about any diameter. Hence IX = Iy and IZ = 21X But 12 = MR2/ 2 So finally, IX = [2/2 = MR2/4 Thus the moment of inertia of a disc about any of its diameter is MR2 / 4 . 4 Find similarly the moment of inertia of a ring about any of its diameters.

Recombinant DNA can then be forced into such cells by incubating the cells with recombinant DNA on ice, followed by placing them brieﬂy at 42°C (heat shock), and then putting them back on ice. This enables the bacteria to take up the recombinant DNA. This is not the only way to introduce alien DNA into host cells. In a method known as micro-injection, recombinant DNA is directly injected into the nucleus of an animal cell. In another method, suitable for plants, cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA in a method known as biolistics or gene gun. And the last method uses ‘disarmed pathogen’ vectors, which when allowed to infect the cell, transfer the recombinant DNA into the host. Now that we have learnt about the tools for constructing recombinant DNA, let us discuss the processes facilitating recombinant DNA technology. 1 1.3 PROCESSES OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY Recombinant DNA technology involves several steps in speciﬁc sequence such as isolation of DNA, fragmentation of DNA by restriction endonucleases, isolation Of a desired DNA fragment, ligation of the DNA fragment into a vector, transferring the recombinant DNA into the host, culturing the host cells in a medium at large scale and extraction of the desired product. Let us examine each of these steps in some details. 1 1.3. 1 Isolation Of the Genetic Material (DNA) Recall that nucleic acid is the genetic material Of all organisms without exception. In majority of organisms this is deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. In order to cut the DNA with restriction enzymes, it needs to be in pure form, free from other macro-molecules. Since the DNA is enclosed within the membranes, we have to break the cell Open to release DNA along with other macromolecules such as RNA, proteins, polysaccharides and also lipids. This can be achieved by treating the bacterial cells / plant or animal tissue with enzymes such as Figure 1 1-5 DNA that lysozyme (bacteria), cellulase (plant cells), chitinase (fungus). You know that genes are located on long molecules Of DNA interwined with proteins such as histones. The RNA can be removed by treatment with ribonuclease whereas proteins can be removed by treatment with protease. Other molecules can be removed by appropriate treatments and puriﬁed DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition of chilled ethanol.

There are also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but they are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make observations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would increase. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably see a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each different kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a species. The number of species that are known and described range between 1 .7- 1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and types of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously being identiﬁed. As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world; we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country. Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we did not ﬁnd ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms we are talking about. Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identiﬁcation. In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established procedures to assign a scientiﬁc name to each known organism. This is acceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientiﬁc names are based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how are animals named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientiﬁc names ensure that each organism has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people (in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure that such a name has not been used for any other known organism. Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientiﬁc names to known organisms. Each name has two components — the Generic name and the speciﬁc epithet. This system of providing a name with two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This naming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all over the world. This naming system using a two word format was found convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of",1

Have you ever wondered how the gametes meet? In a majority of organisms, male gamete is motile and the female gamete is stationary. Exceptions are a few fungi and algae in which both types of gametes are motile (Figure1.7a). There is a need for a medium through which the male -I 3 gametes move. In several simple plants like algae, bryophytes and pteridophytes, water is the medium through which this gamete transfer takes place. A large number of the male gametes, however, fail to reach the female gametes. To compensate this loss of male gametes during transport, the number of male gametes produced is several thousand times the number of female gametes produced. 2019—2020",1

Fig. 7.22 Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 7 .22 acting on a rigid body. The forces F and -F act respectively at points B and A. These points have position vectors 1'1 and 1'2 with respect to origin 0. Let us take the moments of the forces about the origin. The moment of the couple = sum of the moments of the two forces making the couple =r1x (—F) + r2xF =5xF—ng = (1-2—1'1) x F But r1 + AB = r2, and hence AB = r2 — 1-1.

This point is called the fulcrum. A see- saw on the children’s playground is a typical example of a lever.

For translational equilibrium, R—ﬁ—g=o m For considering rotational equilibrium we take the moments about the fulcrum; the sum of moments must be zero, le1 — d2F2 = 0 (ii) Normally the anticlockwise (clockwise) moments are taken to be positive (negative). Note R acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment about the fulcrum. In the case of the lever force F1 is usually some weight to be lifted. It is called the load and its distance from the fulcrum d1 is called the load arm. Force F2 is the effort applied to lift the load; distance d2 of the effort from the fulcrum is the effort arm. Eq. (ii) can be written as le1 = d2 F2 (7. 32a) or load arm x load = effort arm x effort The above equation expresses the principle of moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio F1 /F2 is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.); E_d2 MA. = F2 d (7 .32b) 1 If the effort arm d2 is larger than the load arm, the mechanical advantage is greater than one. Mechanical advantage greater than one means that a small effort can be used to lift a large load. There are several examples of a lever around you besides the see-saw.

Just after world war II, when the world was under shock after the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings, and seeing the ill- effects of radio-activity, Calvin and co-workers put radio- activity to beneficial use. He along with J .A. Bassham studied reactions in green plants forming sugar and other substances from raw materials like carbon dioxide, water and minerals by labelling the carbon dioxide with C14. Calvin proposed that plants change light energy to chemical energy by transferring an electron in an organised array of pigment molecules and other substances. The mapping of the pathway of carbon assimilation in photosynthesis earned him Nobel Prize in 196 1. The principles of photosynthesis as established by Calvin are, at present, being used in studies on renewable resource for energy and materials and basic studies in solar energy research. 201 9-2020",1

Hormones which interact with membrane-bound receptors normally do not enter the target cell, but generate second messengers (e. g., cyclic AMP, 1P3, Ca“ etc) which in turn regulate cellular metabolism (Figure 22.5a).

Equation (9. 10) is the well-known Snell’s law of refraction. We note that n21 is a characteristic of the pair of media (and also depends on the wavelength of light), but is independent of the angle of incidence. From Eq. (9.10), if n21 > 1, r< i, i.e., the refracted ray bends towards the normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be optically denser (or denser, in short) than medium 1. On the other hand, if n21 <1, r > i, the refracted ray bends away from the normal. This is the case when incident ray in a denser medium refracts into a rarer medium. Note: Optical density should not be confused with mass density, which is mass per unit volume. It is possible that mass density of an optically denser medium may be less than that of an optically rarer medium (optical density is the ratio of the speed of light in two media). For example, turpentine and water. Mass density of turpentine is less than that of water but its optical density is higher If n21 is the refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 and n12 the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2, then it should be clear that ”12 :— (9.11) It also follows that if n32 is the refractive index of medium 3 with respect to medium 2 then n32 = n31 X n12, where n31 is the refractive index of medium 3 with respect to medium 1.

In India over a dozen observatories exist, extending from Trivandrum (now Thrivuvananthapuram) in the south to Gulmarg in the north. These observatories work under the aegis of the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), in Colaba, Mumbai. The IIG grew out of the Colaba and Alibag observatories and was formally established in 197 1. The IIG monitors (via its nation-wide observatories), the geomagnetic fields and ﬂuctuations on land, and under the ocean and in space. Its services are used by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), the National Institute of Oceanography (N10) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is a part of the world-wide network which ceaselessly updates the geomagnetic data. Now India has a permanent station called Gangotri. SUMMARY 1. The science of magnetism is old. It has been known since ancient times that magnetic materials tend to point in the north—south direction; like magnetic poles repel and unlike ones attract; and cutting a bar magnet in two leads to two smaller magnets. Magnetic poles cannot be isolated. 2. When a bar magnet of dipole moment m is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, (a) the force on it is zero, [b] the torque on it is m X B, (c) its potential energy is —m-B, where we choose the zero of energy at the orientation when m is perpendicular to B. 3.

CO H 3 E If] Example 13.7 Answer the following questions: (a) (b) (C) Are the equations of nuclear reactions (such as those given in Section 13.7) ‘balanced’ in the sense a chemical equation (e.g., 2H2 + 02—) 2 H20) is? If not, in what sense are they balanced on both sides? If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are conserved in each nuclear reaction, in what way is mass converted into energy (or vice-versa) in a nuclear reaction? A general impression exists that mass-energy interconversion takes place only in nuclear reaction and never in chemical reaction. This is strictly speaking, incorrect. Explain. Solution (a) (b) (C) A chemical equation is balanced in the sense that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. A chemical reaction merely alters the original combinations of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus, the number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved in a nuclear reaction. However, the number of protons and the number of neutrons are both separately conserved in a nuclear reaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of very high energies — what is strictly conserved is the total charge and total ‘baryon number’. We need not pursue this matter here.) In nuclear reactions (e. g., Eq. 13.26), the number of protons and the number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation. We know that the binding energy of a nucleus gives a negative contribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since proton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear reaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same on either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei on the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand side. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy released or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy contributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass of nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa. It is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of mass- energy interconversion. From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical reaction is similar to a nuclear reaction in principle. The energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the difference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms and molecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly speaking, chemical binding energy also gives a negative contribution (mass defect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule, we can equally well say that the difference in the total mass of atoms or molecules, on the two sides of the chemical reaction gets converted into energr or vice-versa. However, the mass defects involved in a chemical reaction are almost a million times smaller than those in a nuclear reaction.This is the reason for the general impression, (which is incorrect) that mass-energy interconversion does not take place in a chemical reaction. 2019-20",0

915,504,"l Physics output. This is what happens in a nuclear reactor. If the chain reaction is uncontrolled, it leads to explosive energy output, as in a nuclear bomb. There is, however, a hurdle in sustaining a chain reaction, as described here. It is known experimentally that slow neutrons (thermal neutrons) are much more likely to cause fission in 2325U than fast neutrons. Also fast neutrons liberated in ﬁssion would escape instead of causing another ﬁssion reaction. The average energy of a neutron produced in fission of 25’25U is 2 MeV. These neutrons unless slowed down will escape from the reactor without interacting with the uranium nuclei, unless a very large amount of fissionable material is used for sustaining the chain reaction. What one needs to do is to slow down the fast neutrons by elastic scattering with light nuclei. In fact, Chadwick’s experiments showed that in an elastic collision with hydrogen the neutron almost comes to rest and proton carries away the energy. This is the same situation as when a marble hits head-on an identical marble at rest. Therefore, in reactors, light nuclei called moderators are provided along with the fissionable nuclei for slowing down fast neutrons. The moderators commonly used are water, heavy water (D20) and graphite. The Apsara reactor at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, uses water as moderator. The other Indian reactors, which are used for power production, use heavy water as moderator. Because of the use of moderator, it is possible that the ratio, K, of number of fission produced by a given generation of neutrons to the number of fission of the preceeding generation may be greater than one. This ratio is called the multiplication factor; it is the measure of the growth rate of the neutrons in the reactor. For K = 1, the operation of the reactor is said to be critical, which is what we wish it to be for steady power operation. If K becomes greater than one, the reaction rate and the reactor power increases exponentially. Unless the factor K is brought down very close to unity, the reactor will become supercritical and can even explode. The explosion of the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine in 1986 is a sad reminder that accidents in a nuclear reactor can be catastrophic. The reaction rate is controlled through control-rods made out of neutron-absorbing material such as cadmium. In addition to control rods, reactors are provided with safety rods which, when required, can be inserted into the reactor and K can be reduced rapidly to less than unity.

Plants need to move molecules over very long distances, much more than animals do; they also do not have a circulatory system in place. Water taken up by the roots has to reach all parts of the plant, up to the very tip of the growing stem. The photosynthates or food synthesised by the leaves have also to be moved to all parts including the root tips embedded deep inside the soil. Movement across short distances, say within the cell, across the membranes and from cell to cell within the tissue has also to take place. To understand some of the transport processes that take place in plants, one would have to recollect one’s basic knowledge about the structure of the cell and the anatomy of the plant body. We also need to revisit our understanding of diffusion, besides gaining some knowledge about chemical potential and ions. When we talk of the movement of substances we need first to define what kind of movement we are talking about, and also what substances we are looking at. In a ﬂowering plant the substances that would need to be transported are water, mineral nutrients, organic nutrients and plant growth regulators. Over small distances substances move by diffusion and by cytoplasmic streaming supplemented by active transport. Transport over longer distances proceeds through the vascular system (the xylem and the phloem) and is called translocation. An important aspect that needs to be considered is the direction of transport. In rooted plants, transport in xylem (of water and minerals) is essentially unidirectional, from roots to the stems. Organic and mineral nutrients however, undergo multidirectional transport. Organic 2019-2020",1

918,1149,"176 BIOLOGY compounds synthesised in the photosynthetic leaves are exported to all other parts of the plant including storage organs. From the storage organs they are later re-exported. The mineral nutrients are taken up by the roots and transported upwards into the stem, leaves and the growing regions. When any plant part undergoes senescence, nutrients may be withdrawn from such regions and moved to the growing parts. Hormones or plant growth regulators and other chemical signals are also transported, though in very small amounts, sometimes in a strictly polarised or unidirectional manner from where they are synthesised to other parts. Hence, in a ﬂowering plant there is a complex trafﬁc of compounds (but probably very orderly) moving in different directions, each organ receiving some substances and giving out some others. 1 1. 1 MEANS OF TRANSPORT 1 1 . 1 . 1 Diffusion Movement by diffusion is passive, and may be from one part of the cell to the other, or from cell to cell, or over short distances, say, from the inter- cellular spaces of the leaf to the outside. No energy expenditure takes place. In diffusion, molecules move in a random fashion, the net result being substances moving from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Diffusion is a slow process and is not dependent on a ‘living system’. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids, but diffusion in solids is more likely rather than of solids. Diffusion is very important to plants since it is the only means for gaseous movement within the plant body. Diffusion rates are affected by the gradient of concentration, the permeability of the membrane separating them, temperature and pressure. 1 l. 1.2 Facilitated Diffusion As pointed out earlier, a gradient must already be present for diffusion to occur. The diffusion rate depends on the size of the substances; obviously smaller substances difﬁise faster. The diffusion of any substance across a membrane also depends on its solubility in lipids, the major constituent of the membrane. Substances soluble in lipids diffuse through the membrane faster. Substances that have a hydrophilic moiety, ﬁnd it difﬁcult to pass through the membrane; their movement has to be facilitated. Membrane proteins provide sites at which such molecules cross the membrane. They do not set up a concentration gradient: a concentration gradient must already be present for molecules to diffuse even if facilitated by the proteins. This process is called facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion special proteins help move substances across membranes without expenditure of ATP energy. Facilitated diffusion cannot cause net transport of molecules from a low to a high concentration — this would require input of energy. Transport rate reaches a maximum when all of the protein transporters are being used (saturation). Facilitated",1

This is why this acceleration is called centripetal acceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was probably known to Newton also some years earlier. “Cent1ipetal” comes ﬁom a Greek term which means ‘centre-seeln‘ng’. Since 1) and R are constant, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also constant. However, the direction changes — pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector. We have another way of describing the velocity and the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion. As the object moves from P to P’ in time At (= t’ — t), the line CP (Fig. 4.19) turns through an angle A0 as shown in the figure. A0 is called angular distance. We define the angular speed a) (Greek letter omega) as the time rate of change of angular displacement : w: _ At (4.45) Now, if the distance travelled by the object during the time At is As, i.e. PP’is As, then : As v = — At but As = R A6.

925,773,"HUMAN REPRODUCTION gonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during the follicular phase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle (about 14th day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture of Graaﬁan follicle and thereby the release of ovum (ovulation). The ovulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the corpus luteum (Figure 3.9). The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium. Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy. During pregnancy all events of the menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation. In the absence of fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes disintegration of the endometrium leading to menstruation, marking a new cycle. In human beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age; that is termed as menopause. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal reproductive phase and extends between menarche and menopause. 3.5 FERTILISATION AND IMPLANTATION During copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina (insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix, enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the fallopian tube (Figure 3.1 lb). The ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region where fertilisation takes place. Fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region. This is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy. The process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called fertilisation. During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum Wigure 3. 10) and induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms. Thus, it ensures that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum. The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum through the PeriVitelline Space zona pellucida and the plasma Zona pellucida \(‘C Menstrual Hygiene Maintenance of hygiene and sanitation during menstruation is very important.

927,171,"Duol Nature of Radiation and Mo’r’rer Every body at any temperature emits radiation of all wavelengths. It also absorbs radiation falling on it. A body which absorbs all the radiation falling on it is called a black body. It is an ideal concept in physics, like concepts of a point mass or uniform motion. A graph of the intensity of radiation emitted by a body versus wavelength is called the black body spectrum No theory in those days could explain the complete black body spectrum! In 1900, Planck hit upon a novel idea. If we assume, he said, that radiation is emitted in packets of energy instead of continuously as in a wave, then we can explain the black body spectrum. Planck himself regarded these quanta, or packets, as a property of emission and absorption, rather than that of light. He derived a formula which agreed with the entire spectrum. This was a confusing mixture of wave and particle pictures — radiation is emitted as a particle, it travels as a wave, and is again absorbed as a particle! Moreover, this put physicists in a dilemma. Should we again accept the particle picture of light just to explain one phenomenon? Then what happens to the phenomena of interference and diffraction which cannot be explained by the particle model? But soon in 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by assuming the particle picture of light. In 1907, Debye explained the low temperature specific heats of solids by using the particle picture for lattice vibrations in a crystalline solid. Both these phenomena belonging to widely diverse areas of physics could be explained only by the particle model and not by the wave model. In 1923, Compton’s x—ray scattering experiments from atoms also went in favour of the particle picture. This increased the dilemma further. Thus by 1923, physicists faced with the following situation. (a) There were some phenomena like rectilinear propagation, reﬂection, refraction, which could be explained by either particle model or by wave model. (b) There were some phenomena such as diffraction and interference which could be explained only by the wave model but not by the particle model. (c) There were some phenomena such as black body radiation, photoelectric effect, and Compton scattering which could be explained only by the particle model but not by the wave model. Somebody in those days aptly remarked that light behaves as a particle on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and as a wave on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and we don't talk of light on Sundays! In 1924, de Broglie proposed his theory of wave—particle duality in which he said that not only photons of light but also ‘particles’ of matter such as electrons and atoms possess a dual character, sometimes behaving like a particle and sometimes as a wave. He gave a formula connecting their mass, velocity, momentum (particle characteristics), with their wavelength and frequency [wave characteristics)! In 1927 Thomson, and Davisson and Germer, in separate experiments, showed that electrons did behave like waves with a wavelength which agreed with that given by de Broglie’s formula. Their experiment was on diffraction of electrons through crystalline solids, in which the regular arrangement of atoms acted like a grating. Very soon, diffraction experiments with other ‘particles’ such as neutrons and protons were performed and these too confirmed with de Broglie’s formula. This confirmed wave—particle duality as an established principle of physics. Here was a principle, physicists thought, which explained all the phenomena mentioned above not only for light but also for the so—called particles. But there was no basic theoretical foundation for wave—particle duality. De Broglie’s proposal was merely a qualitative argument based on symmetry of nature. Wave—particle duality was at best a principle, not an outcome of a sound fundamental theory. It is true that all experiments whatever agreed with de Broglie formula. But physics does not work that way. On the one hand, it needs experimental confirmation, while on the other hand, it also needs sound theoretical basis for the models proposed. This was developed over the next two decades. Dirac developed his theory of radiation in about 1928, and Heisenberg and Pauli gave it a firm footing by 1930. Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman, in late 1940s, produced further refinements and cleared the theory of inconsistencies which were noticed. All these theories mainly put wave—particle duality on a theoretical footing. Although the story continues, it grows more and more complex and beyond the scope of this note. But we have here the essential structure of what happened, and let us be satisfied with it at the moment. Now it is regarded as a natural consequence of present theories of physics that electromagnetic radiation as well as particles of matter exhibit both wave and particle properties in different experiments, and sometimes even in the different parts of the same experiment. 413 2019-20",0

931,231,"Chapter Ten WAVE OPTICS iii i' 10. 1 INTRODUCTION In 1637 Descartes gave the corpuscular model of light and derived Snell’s law. It explained the laws of reﬂection and refraction of light at an interface. The corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction) bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the second medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed by Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of the tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very often attributed to Newton. In 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the wave theory of light — it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in this chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain the phenomena of reﬂection and refraction; however, it predicted that on refraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the prediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much later confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of light in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the wave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850. The wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of Newton’s authority and also because light could travel through vacuum 2019-20",0
932,184,"Electric Charges and Fields 10. POINTS TO PONDER You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges, are compactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not ﬂy away? You will learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force, called the strong force which holds them together. The range of distance where this force is effective is, however, very small ~ 10’14 m. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are not allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus, due to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their structure as they exist in nature. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square law. But gravitational force has only one sign [always attractive), while Coulomb force can be of both signs [attractive and repulsive), allowing possibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite being a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive force in nature. The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb's law is a matter of choice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI units, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic effect (Ampere's law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined by [IC = l A s]. In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is approximately 9 X 109 N m2 CH2. The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge (1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because [as mentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of magnetic forces [forces on current—carrying wires] which are generally much weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit of reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for electric effects. The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related to the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it; charge is a scalar. Charge is not only a scalar [or invariant) under rotation; it is also invariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always true for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under rotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative motion. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property independent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6. Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference. A quantity may be scalar but not conserved [like kinetic energy in an inelastic collision]. On the other hand, one can have conserved vector quantity [e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system). Quantisation of electric charge is a basic [unexplained] law of nature; interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass. Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or equated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things: force on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the presence of other charges, and there are no additional three—body, four—body, etc., forces which arise only when there are more than two charges. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined at the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume charge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution. For a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous across the surface. 2019-20 45",0

In order to explain the observed effect of magnetic ﬁelds on emitters of light (Zeeman effect), he postulated the existence of electric charges in the atom, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902.. He derived a set of transformation equations (known after him, as Lorentz transformation equations) by some tangled mathematical arguments, but he was not aware that these equations hinge on a new concept of space and time. F =q[E(r)+ V><B(r)]EF E = Q / (41:80):2 (4.1) where i' is unit vector along 1', and the ﬁeld E is a vector ﬁeld. A charge q interacts with this ﬁeld and experiences a force F given by F = q E =qu‘ /(4TC80)I‘2 (4.2) As pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field E is not just an artefact but has a physical role. It can convey energy and momentum and is not established instantaneously but takes ﬁnite time to propagate. The concept of a field was specially stressed by Faraday and was incorporated by Maxwell in his unification of electricity and magnetism. In addition to depending on each point in space, it can also vary with time, i.e., be a function of time. In our discussions in this chapter, we will assume that the ﬁelds do not change with time. The ﬁeld at a particular point can be due to one or more charges. If there are more charges the fields add vectorially. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that this is called the principle of superposition. Once the ﬁeld is known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2). Just as static charges produce an electric ﬁeld, the currents or moving charges produce (in addition) a magnetic field, denoted by B (r), again a vector ﬁeld. It has several basic properties identical to the electric ﬁeld. It is deﬁned at each point in space (and can in addition depend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the principle of superposition: the magnetieﬁeld of several sources is the vector addition of magnetic ﬁeld of each individual source. 4.2.2 Magnetic Field, Lorentz Force Let us suppose that there is a point charge q (moving with a velocity v and, located at r at a given time t) in presence of both the electric ﬁeld E (r) and the magnetic ﬁeld B (r). The force on an electric charge q due to both of them can be written as +F (4.3) electric magnetic This force was given first by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive experiments of Ampere and others. It is called the Lorentz force. You have already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we look at the interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld, we ﬁnd the following features. (i) It depends on q, v and B (charge of the particle, the velocity and the magnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a positive charge. (ii) The magnetic force q [ v X B ] includes a vector product of velocity and magnetic ﬁeld. The vector product makes the force due to magnetic 2019-20",0
934,1128,"72 Figure 5.12 Cymose inﬂorescence BIOLOGY ﬂoral axis is termed as inﬂorescence. Depending on whether the apex gets developed into a ﬂower or continues to grow, two major types of inﬂorescences are deﬁned — racemose and cymose. In racemose type of inﬂorescences the main axis continues to grow, the ﬂowers are borne laterally in an acropetal succession (Figure 5.1 1). In cymose type of inﬂorescence the main axis terminates in a ﬂower, hence is limited in growth.The ﬂowers are borne in a basipetal order (Figure 5.12). 5.5 THE FLOWER The ﬂower is the reproductive unit in the angiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction. A typical ﬂower has four different kinds of whorls arranged successively on the swollen end of the stalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle. These are calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs, while androecium and gynoecium are reproductive organs. In some ﬂowers like lily, the calyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth. When a ﬂower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is bisexual. A ﬂower having either only stamens or only carpels is unisexual. In symmetry, the ﬂower may be actinomorphic (radial symmetry) or zygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a ﬂower can be divided into two equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the centre, it is said to be actinomorphic, e. g., mustard, datura, chilli. When it can be divided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane, it is zygomorphic, e.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A ﬂower is asymmetric (irregular) if it cannot be divided into two similar halves by any vertical plane passing through the centre, as in canna. A ﬂower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when the ﬂoral appendages are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers with bracts-reduced leaf found at the base of the pedicel-are called bracteate and those without bracts, ebracteate.",1

Identiﬁcation of such genes, which predispose an individual to certain cancers, may be very helpful in prevention of cancers. Such individuals may be advised to avoid exposure to particular carcinogens to which they are susceptible (e.g., tobacco smoke in case of lung cancer). Treatment of cancer : The common approaches for treatment of cancer are surgery, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. In radiotherapy, tumor cells are irradiated lethally, taking proper care of the normal tissues surrounding the tumor mass. Several chemotherapeutic drugs are used to kill cancerous cells. Some of these are speciﬁc for particular tumors. Majority of drugs have side effects like hair loss, anemia, etc. Most cancers are treated by combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Tumor cells have been shown to avoid detection and destruction by immune system. Therefore, the patients are given substances called biological response modifiers such as a—interferon which activates their immune system and helps in destroying the tumor. 8.5 DRUGS AND ALCOHOL ABUSE Surveys and statistics show that use of drugs and alcohol has been on the rise especially among the youth. This is really a cause of concern as it could result in many harmful effects. Proper education and guidance would enable youth to safeguard themselves against these dangerous behaviour patterns and follow healthy lifestyles. The drugs, which are commonly abused are opioids, cannabinoids and coca alkaloids. Majority of these are obtained from ﬂowering plants. Some are obtained from fungi. Opioids are the drugs, which bind to specific opioid receptors present in our central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Heroin (Figure 8.7), commonly called smack is chemically diacetylmorphine which is a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound. This is obtained by acetylation of morphine (Figure 8.7), which is extracted from the latex of Figure 8.7 Chemical structure of Morphine Figure 8.8 Opium poppy 2019—2020",1
936,1413,"134 Figure 16.4 : Humbodtia decurrens Bedd — highly rare endemic tree of Southern Western Ghats (India) There is an urgent need to educate people to adopt environment-friendly practices and reorient their activities in such a way that our development is harmonious with other life forms and is sustainable. There is an increasing consciousness of the fact that such conservation with sustainable use is possible only with the involvement and cooperation of local communities and individuals. For this, the development of institutional structures at local levels is necessary. The critical problem is not merely the conservation of species nor the habitat but the continuation of process of conservation. The Government of India along with 155 other nations have signed the Convention of Biodiversity at the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 1 992. The world conservation strategy has suggested the following steps for biodiversity conservation: (i) Efforts should be made to preserve the species that are endangered. (ii) Prevention of extinction requires proper planning and management. (iii) Varieties of food crops, forage plants, timber trees, livestock, animals and their wild relatives should be preserved; FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY (iv) Each country should identify habitats of wild relatives and ensure their protection. (v) Habitats where species feed, breed, rest and nurse their young should be safeguarded and protected. (vi) International trade in wild plants and animals be regulated. To protect, preserve and propagate the variety of species within natural boundaries, the Government of India passed the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, under which national parks and sanctuaries were established and biosphere reserves declared. Details of these biosphere reserves are given in the book India: Physical Environment (NCERT, 2006). There are some countries which are situated in the tropical region; they possess a large number of the world’s species diversity. They are called mega diversity centres. There are 12 such countries, namely Mexico, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia in which these centres are located. In order to concentrate resources on those areas that are most vulnerable, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has identified certain areas as biodiversity hotspots (Figure 16.5). Hotspots are defined according to their vegetation. Plants are important because these determine the primary productivity of an ecosystem. Most, but not all, of the hotspots rely on species-rich ecosystems for food, firewood, cropland, and income from timber. In Madagascar, for example, about 85 per cent of the plants and animals are found nowhere else in the world, Other hotspots in wealthy countries are facing different types of pressures. The islands of Hawaii have many unique plants and animals that are threatened by introduced species and land development. 2019-2020",2
937,1382,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS (iii) the occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called ‘competitive release’. A species whose distribution is restricted to a small geographical area because of the presence of a competitively superior species, is found to expand its distributional range dramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed. Connell’s elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea coasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle Balanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller barnacle Chathamalus from that zone. In general, herbivores and plants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than carnivores. Gause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indeﬁnitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually. This may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross generalisations about competition. While they do not rule out the occurrence of interspeciﬁc competition in nature, they point out that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism is ‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete for the same resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times for feeding or different foraging patterns. MacArthur showed that five closely related species of warblers living on the same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to behavioural differences in their foraging activities. Parasitism: Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures free lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher vertebrates. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific (they can parasitise only a single species of host) in such a way that both host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise them, in order to be successful with the same host species. In accordance with their life styles, parasites evolved special adaptations such as the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and high reproductive capacity. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host. The human liver ﬂuke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a ﬁsh) to complete its life cycle. The malarial parasite needs a 2019—2020 235",1

He started with a single grain on the ﬁrst square and proceeded to ﬁll the other squares following minister’s suggested procedure, but by the time he covered half the chess board, the king realised to his dismay that all the wheat produced in his entire kingdom pooled together would still be inadequate to cover all the 64 squares. Now think of a tiny Paramecium starting with just one individual and through binary ﬁssion, doubling in numbers every day, and imagine what a mind- boggling population size it would reach in 64 days. (provided food and space remain unlimited) (ii) Logistic growth: No population of any species in nature has at its disposal unlimited resources to permit exponential growth. This leads to competition between individuals for limited resources. Eventually, the ‘ﬁttest’ individual will survive and reproduce. The governments of many countries have also realised this fact and introduced various restraints with a view to limit human population growth. In nature, a given habitat has enough resources to support a maximum possible number, beyond which no further growth is possible. Let us call this limit as nature’s carrying capacity (K) for that species in that habitat. A population growing in a habitat with limited resources show initially a lag phase, followed by phases of acceleration and deceleration and ﬁnally an asymptote, when the population density reaches the carrying capacity. A plot of N in relation to time (t) results in a sigmoid curve. This type of population growth is called Verhulst—Pearl Logistic Growth (Figure 13.6) and is described by the following equation: K—N = N — dN/dt 1' ( K ) Where N = Population density at time t r = Intrinsic rate of natural increase K = Carrying capacity Since resources for growth for most animal populations are ﬁnite and become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model is considered a more realistic one.

From Eq. (7 .45c), if the external torque is zero, LZ = Ia) = constant (7 .46) For symmetric bodies, from Eq. (7 .44d), Lz may be replaced by L .(L and LZ are respectively the magnitudes of L and L2.) This then is the required form, for fixed axis rotation, of Eq. (7 .29a), which expresses the general law of conservation of angular momentum of a system of particles. Eq. (7 .46) applies to many situations that we come across in daily life. You may do this experiment with your friend. Sit on a swivel chair (a chair with a seat, free to rotate about a pivot) with your arms folded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from, the ground. Ask your friend to rotate the chair rapidly. While the chair is rotating with Fig 7.36 (a) A demonstration of conservation of angular momentum A girl sits on a swivel chair and stretches her arms/ brings her arms closer to the body. considerable angular speed stretch your arms horizontally. What happens? Your angular speed is reduced. If you bring back your arms closer to your body, the angular speed increases again. This is a situation where the principle of conservation of angular momentum is applicable. If friction in the rotational mechanism is neglected, there is no external torque about the axis of rotation of the chair and hence Ice is constant. Stretching the arms increases I about the axis of rotation, resulting in decreasing the angular speed a). Bringing the arms closer to the body has the opposite effect. A circus acrobat and a diver take advantage of this principle. Also, skaters and classical, Indian or western, dancers performing a pirouette (a spinning about a tip—top) on the toes of one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle.

942,1240,"PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION communication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work could not be widely publicised. Secondly, his concept of genes (or factors, in Mendel’s words) as stable and discrete units that controlled the expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend’ with each other, was not accepted by his contemporaries as an explanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature. Thirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological phenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the biologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel’s work suggested that factors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical proof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of. In 1900, three Scientists (de Vries, Correns and von Tschermak) independently rediscovered Mendel’s results on the inheritance of characters. Also, by this time due to advancements in microscopy that were taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division. This led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to double and divide just before each cell division. These were called chromosomes (colored bodies, as they were visualised by staining). By 1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out. Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of chromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used chromosome movement (Figure 5.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 5.3). Recall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis (equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The important things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes occur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous sites on homologous chromosomes.

However by deﬁning a cistron as a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a transcription unit could be said as monocistronic (mostly in eukaryotes) or polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the monocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences — the genes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed sequences are deﬁned as exons. Exons are said to be those sequence that appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by introns. Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or processed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the deﬁnition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment. Inheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory sequences of a structural gene. Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences are loosely deﬁned as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do not code for any RNA or protein. 6.5.3 Types of RNA and the process of Transcription In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA). All three RNAs are needed to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template, tRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play structural and catalytic role during translation.

Physical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit ¢orV POINTS TO PONDER 1. Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a force on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus. when we are talking of electrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each charge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the net Coulomb force on the charge. 2. A capacitor is so conﬁgured that it confines the electric ﬁeld lines within a small region of space. Thus, even though ﬁeld may have considerable strength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a capacitor is small. 3. Electric ﬁeld is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged shell. It is zero inside and gen outside. Electric potential is, however continuous across the surface, equal to q/41t80R at the surface. 4. The torque p X E on a dipole causes it to oscillate about E. Only if there is a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole eventually aligns with E. 5. Potential due to a charge q at its own location is not defined — it is inﬁnite. 6. In the expression qV(r) for potential energy of a charge q, V(r) is the potential due to external charges and not the potential due to q. As seen in point 5, this expression will be ill-deﬁned if V(r) includes potential due to a charge q itself. 85 2019-20",0

But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.74§ rounded off to three significant figures becomes 2.74. On the other hand, the number 2.73_5_ rounded off to three significant ﬁgures becomes 2.74 since the preceding digit is odd. In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps, one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation. Similarly, a number known to be within many significant figures, such as in 2.99792458 x 108 m/s for the speed of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an approximate value 3 x 108 m/s , which is often employed in computations. Finally, remember that exact numbers that appear in formulae like ’L 2 7c in T = 27: —, have a large (infinite) number 9 of significant figures. The value of 7t = 3.1415926... is known to a large number of significant figures.

(1) If the length and breadth of a thin rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there are three significant figures in each measurement. It means that the length I may be written as l= 16.2 i 0.1 cm = 16.2 cm i 0.6 %. Similarly, the breadth b may be written as b= 10.1 $0.1 cm = 10.1 cm i 1 % Then, the error of the product of two (or more) experimental values, using the combination of errors rule, will be lb= 163.62 cmZ: 1.6% = 163.62 1 2.6 cm2 This leads us to quote the final result as lb = 164 i 3 cm2 Here 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the estimation of area of rectangular sheet.

952,915,"BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning into a vector. (i) Origin of replication (ori) : This is a sequence from where replication starts and any piece of DNA when linked to this sequence can be made to replicate within the host cells. This sequence is also responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA. So, if one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA it should be cloned in a vector whose origin support high copy number. (ii) Selectable marker : In addition to ‘ori’, the vector requires a selectable marker, which helps in identifying and eliminating non- transformants and selectively permitting the growth of the transformants. Transformation is a procedure through which a piece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium [you will study the process in subsequent section). Normally, the genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin, etc., are considered useful selectable markers for E. coli. The normal E. coli cells do not carry resistance against any of these antibiotics. (iii) Cloning sites: In order to link the EcoRI 01a 1 Hind 1“ alien DNA, the vector needs to have very few, preferably single, recognition sites for the commonly used restriction enzymes. Presence of more than one recognition sites within the vector will generate several fragments, which will complicate the gene cloning (Figure 1 1.4). The ligation of alien DNA is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the two antibiotic resistance genes. For Pvu II example, you can ligate a foreign DNA at the BamH I site of tetracycline Figure 11.4 E. coli cloning vector pBR322 showing restriction sites resistance gene in the vector pBR322.

953,1517,"184 Accountancy 6.3 Preparation of Trial Balance Theoritically spreading, a trial balance can be prepared in the following three ways: (i) Totals Method (ii) Balances Method (iii) Totals-cum-balances Method 6.3.1 Totals method Under this method, total of each side in the ledger (debit and credit) is ascertained separately and shown in the trial balance in the respective columns. The total of debit column of trial balance should agree with the total of credit column in the trial balance because the accounts are based on double entry system. However, this method is not widely used in practice, as it does not help in assuming accuracy of balances of various accounts and and preparation of the fianancial statements. 6.3.2 Balances Method This is the most widely used method in practice. Under this method trial balance is prepared by showing the balances of all ledger accounts and then totalling up the debit and credit columns of the trial balance to assure their correctness. The account balances are used because the balance summarises the net effect of all transactions relating to an account and helps in preparing the financial statements. It may be noted that in trial balance, normally in place of balances in individual accounts of the debtors, a figure of sundry debtors is shown, and in place of individual accounts of creditors, a figure of sundry creditors is shown. 6.3.3 Totals-cum—balances Method This method is a combination of totals method and balances method. Under this method four columns for amount are prepared. Two columns for writing the debit and credit totals of various accounts and two columns for writing the debit and credit balances of these accounts. However, this method is also not used in practice because it is time consuming and hardly serves any additional or special purpose. Let us now learn how will the trial balance be prepared using each of these methods with the help of the following example: Mr. Rawat’s ledger shows the following accounts for his business.

955,692,"Duol Nature of Radiation and Moi-fer A photocell is a technological application of the photoelectric effect. It is a device whose electrical properties are affected by light. It is also sometimes called an electric eye. A photocell consists of a semi-cylindrical photo-sensitive metal plate C (emitter) and a wire loop A (collector) supported in an evacuated glass or quartz bulb. It is connected to the external circuit having a high-tension battery B and microammeter (uA) as shown in the Figure. Sometimes, instead of the plate C, a thin layer of photosensitive material is pasted on the inside of the bulb. A part of the bulb is left clean for the light to enter it. When light of suitable wavelength falls on the emitter C, photoelectrons are emitted. These photoelectrons are drawn to the collector A. Photocurrent of the order of a few microampere can be normally obtained from a photo cell. A photocell converts a change in intensity of illumination into a change in photocurrent. This current can be used to operate control systems and in light measuring devices. A photocell of lead sulphide sensitive to infrared radiation is used in electronic ignition circuits. In scientific work, photo cells are used whenever it is necessary to measure the intensity of light. Light meters in photographic cameras make use of photo cells to measure the intensity of incident light. The photocells, inserted in the door light electric circuit, are used as automatic door opener. A person approaching a doorway 0 ”A may interrupt a light beam which is incident on a photocell. The abrupt change in photocurrent may be used to start a motor which opens the door or rings an alarm. They are used in the control of a counting device which records every interruption of the light beam caused by a person or object passing across the beam. So photocells help count the persons entering an auditorium, provided they enter the hall one by one. They are used for detection of trafﬁc law defaulters: an alarm may be sounded whenever a beam of (invisible) radiation is intercepted. In burglar alarm, (invisible) ultraviolet light is continuously made to fall on a photocell installed at the doorway. A person entering the door interrupts the beam falling on the photocell. ’Ihe abrupt change in photocurrent is used to start an electric bell ringing. In ﬁre alarm, a number of photocells are installed at suitable places in a building. In the event of breaking out of fire, light radiations fall upon the photocell. This completes the electric circuit through an electric bell or a siren which starts operating as a warning signal. Photocells are used in the reproduction of sound in motion pictures and in the television camera for scanning and telecasting scenes. They are used in industries for detecting minor ﬂaws or holes in metal sheets. i _ —34 Incident light Collector Emitter A photo cell p=mv=0.l2kg><20ms‘1=2.4Okgms‘1 6.63x10‘34J s ,4- _ p _ 2.40 kgms‘1 2019-20",0

957,619,"342 PHYSICS 1 4.2 PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS Fig. 14. 1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it comes back to the initial point and repeats the process identically. If you draw a graph of its height above the ground versus time, it would look something like Fig. 14. 1 (a). If a child climbs up a step, comes down, and repeats the process identically, its height above the ground would look like that in Fig. 14. 1 (b). When you play the game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between your palm and the ground. its height versus time graph would look like the one in Fig. 14. 1 (c). Note that both the curved parts in Fig. 14.1 (c) are sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s equation of motion (see section 3.6), h = lit +5 gt2 for downward motion, and l h = ut — E gt2 for upward motion, with different values of u in each case. These are examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion. x(t) (b) x(t) (c) T Fig. 14.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T is shown in each case. 2019-20 Very often, the body undergoing periodic motion has an equilibrium position somewhere inside its path. When the body is at this position no net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is left there at rest, it remains there forever. If the body is given a small displacement from the position, a force comes into play which tries to bring the body back to the equilibrium point, giving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For example, a ball placed in a bowl will be in equilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little from the point, it will perform oscillations in the bowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but every periodic motion need not be oscillatory. Circular motion is a periodic motion, but it is not oscillatory. There is no significant difference between oscillations and vibrations. It seems that when the frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like, the oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when the frequency is high, we call it vibration (like, the vibration of a string of a musical instrument). Simple harmonic motion is the simplest form of oscillatory motion. This motion arises when the force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement from the mean position, which is also the equilibrium position. Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force is directed towards the mean position. In practice, oscillating bodies eventually come to rest at their equilibrium positions because of the damping due to friction and other dissipative causes. However, they can be forced to remain oscillating by means of some external periodic agency. We discuss the phenomena of damped and forced oscillations later in the chapter. Any material medium can be pictured as a collection of a large number of coupled oscillators. The collective oscillations of the constituents of a medium manifest themselves as waves. Examples of waves include water waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves. We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next chapter. 14.2.1 Period and frequency We have seen that any motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion. The smallest interval of time after which the motion is repeated is called its period. Let us denote the period by the symbol T. Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions,",0

How long do you think the pollen grains retain Viability? The period for which pollen grains remain viable is highly variable and to some extent depends on the prevailing temperature and humidity. In some cereals such as rice and wheat, pollen grains lose viability within 30 minutes of their release, and in some members of Rosaceae, Leguminoseae and Solanaceae, they maintain viability for months. You may have heard of storing semen/ sperms of many animals including humans for artiﬁcial insemination. It is possible to store pollen grains of a large number of species for years in liquid nitrogen (— 196°C). Such stored pollen can be used as pollen banks, similar to seed banks, in crop breeding programmes. 2.2.2 The Pistil, Megasporangium (ovule) and Embryo sac The gynoecium represents the female reproductive part of the ﬂower. The gynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have more than one pistil (multicarpellary). When there are more than one, the pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 2.7b) or may be free (apocarpous) (Figure 2.7 c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 2.7a), the stigma, style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform for pollen grains. The style is the elongated slender part beneath the stigma. The basal bulged part of the pistil is the ovary. Inside the ovary is the ovarian cavity (locule). The placenta is located inside the ovarian cavity.

Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the allele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may be effected. The phenotype / trait will only be dependent on the functioning of the unmodiﬁed allele. The unmodiﬁed (functioning) allele, which represents the original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modiﬁed allele is generally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait is seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced. 5.2.2.2 Co-dominance Till now we were discussing crosses where the F1 resembled either of the two parents (dominance) or was in—between (incomplete dominance). But, in the case of co-dominance the F1 generation resembles both parents. A good example is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO blood grouping in human beings. ABO blood groups are controlled by the gene I. The plasma membrane of the red blood cells has sugar polymers that protrude from its surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the gene. The gene (1) has three alleles I"", 1‘B and i. The alleles I“ and I“ produce a slightly different form of the sugar while allele i does not produce any sugar. Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses any two of the three I gene alleles. IA and IB are completely dominant over i, in other words when IA and i are present only I“ expresses (because i does not produce any sugar), and when 15’ and i are present IB expresses. But when 1A and IB are present together they both express their own types of sugars: this is because of co-dominance. Hence red blood cells have both A and B types of sugars. Since there are three different alleles, there are six different combinations of these three alleles that are possible, and therefore, a total of six different genotypes of the human ABO blood types (Table 5.2). How many phenotypes are possible?

The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being products of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations leading to variations. Seed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of mature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food throughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you imagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds which genninate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored? How long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This period again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose Viability within a few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years. Some seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several records of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine, Lupinus arcticus excavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and ﬂowered after an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy. A recent record of 2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera discovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace near the Dead Sea. Aﬁer completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of ﬂowering plants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous reproductive capacity of some ﬂowering plants by asking the following questions: How many eggs are present in an embryo sac? How many embryo sacs are present in an ovule? How many ovules are present in an ovary? How many ovaries are present in a typical ﬂower? How many ﬂowers are present on a tree? And so on... Can you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large number of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit contain thousands of tiny seeds. Similar is the case in fruits of some parasitic species such as Orobanche and Striga. Have you seen a tiny seed of Ficus? How large is the tree of Ficus developed from that tiny seed. How many billions of seeds does each Ficus tree produce? Can you imagine any other example in which such a tiny structure can produce such a large biomass over the years? 2.5 APOMIXIS AND POLYEMBRYONY Although seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few ﬂowering plants such as some species of Asteraceae and grasses, have evolved a special mechanism, to produce seeds without fertilisation, called apomixis. What is fruit production without fertilisation called? Thus, apomixis is a form of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. There are several ways of development of apomictic seeds. In some species, the diploid egg cell is formed without reduction division and develops into the embryo without fertilisation. More often, as in many Citrus and Mango 2019-2020",1

The substitution of amino acid in the globin protein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of the beta globin gene from GAG to GUG. The mutant haemoglobin molecule undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change in the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like structure (Figure 5. 1 5). Phenylketonuria : This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as the autosomal recessive trait. The affected individual lacks an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result of this phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid and other derivatives. Accumulation of these in brain results in mental retardation. These are also excreted through urine because of its poor absorption by kidney. Thalassemia : This is also an autosome-linked recessive blood disease transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are unaffected carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The defect could be due to either mutation or deletion which ultimately results in reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains (0L and B chains) that make up haemoglobin. This causes the formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules resulting into anaemia which is characteristic of the disease. ’Ihalassemia can be classiﬁed according to which chain of the haemoglobin molecule is affected. In 0c Thalassemia, production of Of globin chain is affected while in B Thalassemia, production of B globin chain is affected. 0c Thalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBAl and HBA2 on chromosome 1 6 of each parent and it is observed due to mutation or deletion of one or more of the four genes. The more genes affected, the less alpha globin molecules produced. While B Thalassemia is controlled by a single gene HBB on chromosome 1 1 of each parent and occurs due to mutation of one or both the genes. Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell anaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too few globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of synthesising an incorrectly functioning globin. 5.8.3 Chromosomal Disorders The chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes. Failure of segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results in the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called aneuploidy. For example, Down’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21. Similarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in human females. Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division results in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and, this phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This condition is often seen in plants. The total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46 (23 pairs). Out of these 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of chromosomes are sex chromosome.

970,864,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS 1 1.6. 1 The Pressure Flow or Mass Flow Hypothesis The accepted mechanism used for the translocation of sugars from source to sink is called the pressure ﬂow hypothesis. (see Figure 1 1.10). As glucose is prepared at the source (by photosynthesis) it is converted to sucrose (a dissacharide). The sugar is then moved in the form of sucrose into the companion cells and then into the living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. This process of loading at the source produces a hypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up the phloem sap will move to areas of lower pressure. At the sink osmotic pressure must be reduced. Again active transport is necessary to move the sucrose out of the phloem sap and into the cells which will use the sugar — converting it into energy, starch, or cellulose. As sugars are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases and water moves out of the phloem. To summarise, the movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the source, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube. Loading of the phloem sets up a water potential gradient that facilitates the mass movement in the phloem. Phloem tissue is composed of sieve tube cells, which form long columns with holes in their end walls called sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass through the holes in the sieve plates, so forming continuous ﬁlaments. As hydrostatic pressure in the sieve tube of phloem increases, pressure ﬂow begins, and the sap moves through the phloem. Meanwhile, at the sink, incoming sugars are actively transported out of the phloem and removed Sugars leave sieve tubes; water follows by osmosis Tip of stem Sugar solution ﬂows to regions of low turgor pressure 1 Phloem for metabolism and storage; water follows by osmosis Root Sugars enter sieve tubes; water follows by osmosis Sugars leave sieve tube =High turgor pressure Figure11.10 Diagrammatic presentation of mechanism of translocation 191",1

He concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been transformed by the heat-killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming principle’, transferred from the heat-killed S strain, had enabled the R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent. This must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, the biochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from his experiments. Biochemical Characterisation of Transforming Principle Prior to the work of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty (1933-44), the genetic material was thought to be a protein. They worked to determine the biochemical nature of ‘transforming principle’ in Griffith's experiment. They puriﬁed biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the heat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into S cells. They discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria to become transformed. They also discovered that protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and RNA-digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the transforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase did inhibit transformation, suggesting that the DNA caused the transformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material, but not all biologists were convinced. Can you think of any difference between DNAs and DNase? 6.2. 1 The Genetic Material is DNA The unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from the experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952). They worked with Viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages. The bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material then enters the bacterial cell. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic material as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus particles. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein or DNA from the viruses that entered the bacteria. They grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur. Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains phosphorus but protein does not. Similarly, viruses grown on radioactive sulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because DNA does not contain sulfur. 2019—2020",1

Porifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of organisation and have characteristic ﬂagellated choanocytes. The coelenterates have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic, sessile or ﬁ‘ee-ﬂoating. The ctenophores are marine animals with comb plates. The platyhelminths have ﬂat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry. The parasitic forms show distinct suckers and hooks. Aschelminthes are pseudocoelomates and include parasitic as well as non- parasitic roundworms. Annelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom. The arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised by the presence of j01nted appendages. The molluscs have a sp’ft body surrounded by an external calcareous shell. The body 1s covered mth‘ve ﬁg. mal Skeleton made of chitin. The echinoderms possess a spiny skin.

Classes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia have two pairs of limbs and are thus grouped under Tetrapoda. The amphibians have adapted to live both on land and water. Reptiles are characterised by the presence of dry and corniﬁed skin. Limbs are absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibians and reptiles are poikilothermous (cold- blooded). Aves are warm-blooded animals with feathers on their bodies and forelimbs modiﬁed into wings for ﬂying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking, swimming, perching or clasping.

In India, this is available at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. While dealing with atoms and molecules, the kilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case, there is an important standard unit of mass, called the unified atomic mass unit (u), which has been established for expressing the mass of atoms as 1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u = (1 / 12) of the mass of an atom of carbon- 12 isotope (1: C) including the mass of electrons = 1.66 X 10—27 kg Mass of commonly available objects can be determined by a common balance like the one used in a grocery shop.

979,133,"Atomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece Though John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in ancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules. In the Vaiseshika school of thought in India founded by Kailada [Sixth century BC.) the atomic picture was developed in considerable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal. indivisible, inﬁnitesimal and ultimate parts of matter. It was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end. there would be no difference between a mustard seed and the Meru mountain. The four kinds of atoms [Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the smallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi [Eaith). Ap (water). Tejas (ﬁre) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic mass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and was continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules [e.g. two atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule dvyanuka. three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule). their properties depending upon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms. The size of the atoms was also estimated. by conjecture or by methods that are not known to us. The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara. a famous biography of the Buddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic size. of the order of lO’lom. In ancient Greece. Democritus [Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The word ‘atom' means ‘indivisible' in Greek. According to him. atoms differ from each other physically. in shape. size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed by their combination.

The charge may be ﬁxed or ﬂoating. A ﬁxed charge is created on a speciﬁc asset whereas a ﬂoating charge is on the general assets of the company. The ﬁxed charge is created against those assets which are held by a company for use in operations not meant for sale whereas ﬂoating charge involves all assets excluding those assigned to the secured creditors. Unsecured Debentures: Unsecured debentures do not have a speciﬁc charge on the assets of the company. However, a ﬂoating charge may be created on these debentures by default. Normally, these kinds of debentures are not issued. 2.3.2 From the Point of view of Tenure (a) (b) Redeemable Debentures: Redeemable debentures are those which are payable on the expiry of the speciﬁc period either in lump sum or in Instalments during the life time of the company. Debentures can be redeemed either at par or at premium. Irredeemable Debentures: Irredeemable debentures are also known as Perpetual Debentures because the company does not give any undertaking for the repayment of money borrowed by issuing such debentures. These debentures are repayable on the winding-up of a company or on the expiry of a long period. 2.3.3 From the Point of view of Convertibility (a) (1?) Convertible Debentures: Debentures which are convertible into equity shares or in any other security either at the option of the company or the debentureholders are called convertible debentures. These debentures are either fully convertible or partly convertible. Non-Convertible Debentures: The debentures which cannot be converted into shares or in any other securities are called non- convertible debentures. Most debentures issued by companies fall in this category. 2.3.4 From Coupon Rate Point of view (a) Specific Coupon Rate Debentures: These debentures are issued with a speciﬁed rate of interest, which is called the coupon rate. The speciﬁed rate may either be ﬁxed or ﬂoating. The ﬂoating interest rate is usually tagged with the bank rate.",3

Pour this water in a long test tube and shine the laser light from top, as shown in Fig. 9.13(c). Adjust the direction of the laser beam such that it is totally internally reﬂected every time it strikes the walls of the tube. This is similar to what happens in optical ﬁbres.

The refractive index of air increases with its density. Hotter air is less dense, and has smaller refractive index than the cooler air. If the air currents are small, that is, the air is still, the optical density at different layers of air increases with height. As a result, light from a tall object such as a tree, passes through a medium whose refractive index decreases towards the ground. Thus, a ray of light from such an object successively bends away from the normal and undergoes total internal reﬂection, if the angle of incidence for the air near the ground exceeds the critical angle. This is shown in (C) Fig. 9.14(b). To a distant observer, the light appears to be coming FIGURE 9J3 from somewhere below the ground.

We note that the saturation currents are now found to be at higher values. This shows that more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the intensity of incident radiation. But the stopping potential remains the same as that for the incident radiation of intensity 11, as shown graphically in Fig. 1 1.3. Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the stopping potential is independent of its intensity. In other words, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source and the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident radiation. 1 1 .4.3 Effect of frequency of incident radiation on stopping potential We now study the relation between the T frequency v of the incident radiation and the stopping potential V0. We suitably adjust the same intensity of light radiation at various frequencies and study the variation of photocurrent with collector plate potential. The resulting variation is shown in Fig. 1 1.4. We obtain different values of stopping potential but the same value of the saturation current for incident radiation of different frequencies. The energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the incident radiations. The stopping potential is more negative for higher frequencies of incident radiation.

989,147,"DUOI Nature Of Radiation and MOHer energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity (Fig. 1 1.5). (iv) The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any apparent time lag (~ 1 O‘gs or less), even when the incident radiation is made exceedingly dim. 1 1.5 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT The wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth century. The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were explained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light. According to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting of electric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over the region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this wave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric emission given in the previous section. According to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface of the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant energy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater the intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron. In this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the surface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no matter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of radiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to the electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape from the metal surface . A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist. These expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i), (ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 1 1.4.3. Further, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of energy by electron takes place continuously over the entire wavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy, the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small. Explicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single electron to pick up sufﬁcient energy to overcome the work function and come out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to observation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous. In short, the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of photoelectric emission. 1 1 .6 EINSTEIN’s PHOTOELECTRIC EQUATION: ENERGY QUANTUM OF RADIATION In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879- 1955) proposed a radically new picture of electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect. In this picture, photoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of energy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units — the so called quanta of energy of radiation. Each quantum of radiant energy 2019-20 393",0

Permanent tissues having all cells similar in structure and function are called simple tissues. Permanent tissues having many different types of cells are called complex tissues. 6. 1 .2. 1 Simple Tissues A simple tissue is made of only one type of cells. The various simple tissues in plants are parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma (Figure 6.2). Parenchyma forms the major component within organs. The cells of the parenchyma are generally isodiametric. They may be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or elongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made up of cellulose. They may either be closely packed or have small intercellular spaces. The parenchyma performs various functions like photosynthesis, storage, secretion. The collenchyma occurs in layers below the epidermis in most of the dicotyledonous plants. It is found either as a homogeneous layer or in patches. It consists of cells which are much thickened at the corners due to a deposition of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Collenchymatous cells may be oval, spherical or polygonal and often contain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food when they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces are absent. They provide mechanical support to the growing parts of the plant such as young stem and petiole of a leaf. Sclerenchyma consists of long, narrow cells with thick and lignified cell walls having a few or numerous pits. They are usually dead and without protoplasts. On the basis of variation in form, structure, origin and development, sclerenchyma may be either fibres or sclereids. The ﬁbres are thick-walled, elongated and pointed cells, generally occuring in groups, in various parts of the plant.

If a force acts on a single particle at a point P whose position with respect to the origin 0 is given by the position vector 1' (Fig. 7 . 18), the moment of the force acting on the particle with respect to the origin 0 is defined as the vector product 1: = r x F (7.23) The moment of force (or torque) is a vector quantity. The symbol 1: stands for the Greek letter tau. The magnitude of 1: is 1': rFsin0 (7.24a) where r is the magnitude of the position vector r, i.e. the length OP, Fis the magnitude of force F and 0 is the angle between 1' and F as shown. Moment of force has dimensions M LZT'Z. Its dimensions are the same as those of work or energy. It is, however, a very different physical quantity than work. Moment of a force is a vector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of moment of force is newton metre (N m). The magnitude of the moment of force may be written 1 = (r sin 0)F = riF (7.24b) or 2': rFsin6= rFi (7.240) where ri = r sine is the perpendicular distance of the line of action of F from the origin and FJ: Fsin 6) is the component of F in the direction perpendicular to 1'. Note that 1' = 0 if r= O, F= O or 0 = Ooor 1800 . Thus, the moment of a force vanishes if either the magnitude of the force is zero, or if the line of action of the force passes through the origin. One may note that since rXF is a vector product, properties of a vector product of two vectors apply to it. If the direction of F is reversed, the direction of the moment of force is reversed. If directions of both r and F are reversed, the direction of the moment of force remains the same. 7.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle Just as the moment of a force is the rotational analogue of force in linear motion, the quantity angular momentum is the rotational analogue of linear momentum. We shall first define angular momentum for the special case of a single particle and look at its usefulness in the context of single particle motion. We shall then extend the deﬁnition of angular momentum to systems of particles including rigid bodies. Like moment of a force, angular momentum is also a vector product. It could also be referred to as moment of (linear) momentum. From this term one could guess how angular momentum is defined. Consider a particle of mass m and linear momentum p at a position 1' relative to the origin 0. The angular momentum] of the particle with respect to the origin 0 is defined to be 1 = r x p (7 .25a) The magnitude of the angular momentum vector is l=rpsin6 (7.26a) where p is the magnitude of p and 0 is the angle between 1' and p. We may write l=rpl or rip (7.26b) where rl (= r sine) is the perpendicular distance of the directional line of p from the origin and p i (= p sin 6) is the component of p in a direction perpendicular to r. We expect the angular momentum to be zero (1 = 0), if the linear momentum vanishes (p = 0), if the particle is at the origin (r = O), or if the directional line of p passes through the origin 6 = O0 or 180°. 2019-20",0

We will have to supply an energy of 7.68 MeV to a 2§§U nucleus to make it emit a proton. 13.6.3 Beta decay In beta decay, a nucleus spontaneously emits an electron (ff—decay) or a positron (6+ decay). A common example of [3' decay is f:P->f§S+e‘+1—/ (13.22) and that of [3+ decay is §§Na —> f3Ne+ e+ + v (13.23) The decays are governed by the Eqs. (13.14) and (13.1 5), so that one can never predict which nucleus will undergo decay, but one can characterize the decay by a half-life T1/2 . For example, T1/2 for the decays above is respectively 14.3 d and 2.6y. The emission of electron in B'decay is accompanied by the emission of an antineutrino (17 ); in b” decay, instead, a neutrino (v) is generated. Neutrinos are neutral particles with very small (possiblly, even zero) mass compared to electrons. They have only weak interaction with other particles. They are, therefore, very difﬁcult to detect, since they can penetrate large quantity of matter (even earth) without any interaction. 2019-20",0
993,598,"object which moves in a circle is being constantly accelerated — the acceleration being centripetal in nature. According to classical electromagnetic theory, an accelerating charged particle emits radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves. The energy of an accelerating electron should therefore, continuously decrease. The electron would spiral inward and eventually fall into the nucleus (Fig. 12.7). Thus, such an atom can not be stable. Further, according to the classical electromagnetic theory, the frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of revolution. As the electrons spiral inwards, their angular velocities and hence their frequencies would change continuously, and so will the frequency of the light emitted. Thus, they would emit a continuous spectrum, in contradiction to the line spectrum actually observed.

994,715,"Electric Charges and Fields arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect (force on q2) and the cause (motion of ‘11)- It is precisely here that the notion of electric ﬁeld (strictly, electromagnetic ﬁeld) is natural and very useful. The ﬁeld picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1 produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed c, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of ﬁeld elegantly accounts for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an independent dynamics of their own, i.e., they evolve according to laws of their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time- dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time and then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday and is now among the central concepts in physics.

The direction of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged and a proton falls through the same distance [Fig 1.13(b)]. Compute the time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free fall under gravity’. mm (a) (b) FIGURE 1.13 Solution In Fig. l.13(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged electron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is the magnitude of the electric field.

995,395,"Roy Optics and Optical Instruments THE BROWNING CHILD, LIFEGUARD AND SNELL’S LAW Consider a rectangular swimming pool PQSR; see ﬁgure here. A lifeguard sitting at G outside the pool notices a child drowning at a point C. The guard wants to reach the child in the shortest possible time. Let SR be the side of the pool between G and C. Should he/ she P Q take a straight line path GAC between G and C or GBC in which the path BC in water would be the shortest, or some other path GXC? The guard knows that his / her running speed v1 on ground is higher than his / her swimming speed 02. Suppose the guard enters water at X. Let GX =11 and XC =12. Then the time taken to reach from G to C would be t=_li+l_2 v1 v2 To make this time minimum, one has to differentiate it (with respect to the coordinate of X) and find the point X when tis a minimum. On doing all this algebra (which we skip here), we find that the guard should enter water at a point where Snell’s law is satisfied. To understand this, draw a perpendicular LM to side SR at X. Let AGXM = iand ACXL = r. Then it can be seen that t is minimum when sini v1 sin r 02 In the case of light 01/02, the ratio of the velocity of light in vacuum to that in the medium, is the refractive index n of the medium. In short, whether it is a wave or a particle or a human being, whenever two mediums and two velocities are involved, one must follow Snell’s law if one wants to take the shortest time. 9.4 TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION When light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium at the interface, it is partly reﬂected back into the same medium and partly refracted to the second medium. This reﬂection is called the internal reﬂection. When a ray of light enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal, for example, the ray AO1 B in Fig. 9.12. The incident ray A01 is partially reﬂected (01 C) and partially transmitted (01B) or refracted, the angle of refraction (r) being larger than the angle of incidence (i). As the angle of incidence increases, so does the angle of refraction, till for the ray A03, the angle of refraction is 7t/ 2. The refracted ray is bent so much away from the normal that it grazes the surface at the interface between the two media. This is shown by the ray AO3 D in Fig. 9.12. If the angle of incidence is increased still further (e. g., the ray A04), refraction is not possible, and the incident ray is totally reﬂected. 319 2019-20",0
996,1228,"Figure 10.6 Secondary treatment BIOLOGY heterotrophic microbes naturally present in the sewage. This treatment is carried out in two stages: Primary treatment : These treatment steps basically involve physical removal of particles — large and small — from the sewage through ﬁltration and sedimentation. These are removed in stages; initially, ﬂoating debris is removed by sequential ﬁltration. Then the grit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by sedimentation. All solids that settle form the primary sludge, and the supernatant forms the efﬂuent. The efﬂuent from the primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment. Secondary treatment or Biological treatment : The primary efﬂuent is passed into large aeration tanks (Figure 10.6) where it is constantly agitated mechanically and air is pumped into it. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into ﬂocs (masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures). While growing, these microbes consume the major part of the organic matter in the efﬂuent. This significantly reduces the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) of the efﬂuent. BOD refers to the amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic matter in one liter of water were oxidised by bacteria. The sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water and thus, indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential. Once the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced significantly, the efﬂuent is then passed into a settling tank where the bacterial ‘ﬂocs’ are allowed to sediment. This sediment is called activated sludge. A small part of the activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank to serve as the inoculum. The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters. Here, other kinds of bacteria, which grow anaerobically, digest the bacteria and the fungi in the sludge. During this digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. These gases form biogas and can be used as source of energy as it is inﬂammable. The efﬂuent from the secondary treatment plant is generally released into natural water bodies like rivers and streams. An aerial view of such a plant is shown in Figure 10.7. 2019-2020",1

1000,1075,"BIOLOGY Natural methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum and sperms meeting. Periodic abstinence is one such method in which the couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to l 7 of the menstrual cycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are very high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by Figure 4.1(a) Condom for male Figure 4.1(b) Condom for female Figure 4.2. Copper T (CuT) abstaining from coitus during this period, conception could be prevented. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is another method in which the male partner withdraws his penis from the vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid insemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation and therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of intense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long as the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of conception are almost nil. However, this method has been reported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six months following parturition. As no medicines or devices are used in these methods, side effects are almost nil. Chances of failure, though, of this method are also high. In barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such methods are available for both males and females. Condoms (Figure 4. 1 a, b) are barriers made of thin rubber / latex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or vagina and cervix in the female, just before coitus so that the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female reproductive tract. This can prevent conception. ‘Nirodh’ is a popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms has increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of protecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS. Both the male and the female condoms are disposable, can be self-inserted and thereby gives privacy to the user. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are also barriers made of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive tract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent conception by blocking the entry of sperms through the cervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and foams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase their contraceptive efficiency. Another effective and popular method is the use of Intra Uterine m Devices (IUDs). These devices are inserted by doctors or expert nurses in the uterus through vagina. These Intra Uterine Devices are presently — available as the non-medicated IUDs (e. g., Lippes loop), copper releasing IUDs (CuT, Cu7, Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs (Progestasert, LNG-20) (Figure 4.2).

The wide range of living types is amazing. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms, be it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, deserts or hot springs, leave us speechless. The beauty of a galloping horse, of the migrating birds, the valley of ﬂowers or the attacking shark evokes awe and a deep sense of wonder. The ecological conﬂict and cooperation among members of a population and among populations of a community or even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reﬂect on — what indeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The ﬁrst is a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to the non-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer to what the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering the second question. We will try to reﬂect on — what is living? 1. 1 WHAT IS ‘LIVING’? When we try to define ‘living’, we conventionally look for distinctive characteristics exhibited by living organisms. Growth, reproduction, ability to sense environment and mount a suitable response come to our mind immediately as unique features of living organisms. One can add a few more features like metabolism, ability to self-replicate, self-organise, interact and emergence to this list. Let us try to understand each of these. All living organisms grow.

1003,965,"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION combined diversity at all the levels of biological organisation. The most important of them are— (i) Genetic diversity: A single species might show high diversity at the genetic level over its distributional range. The genetic variation shown by the medicinal plant Rauwolﬁa vomitoria growing in different Himalayan ranges might be in terms of the potency and concentration of the active chemical (reserpine) that the plant produces. India has more than 50,000 genetically different strains of rice, and 1,000 varieties of mango. (ii) Species diversity: The diversity at the species level, for example, the Western Ghats have a greater amphibian species diversity than the Eastern Ghats. (iii) Ecological diversity: At the ecosystem level, India, for instance, with its deserts, rain forests, mangroves, coral reefs, wetlands, estuaries, and alpine meadows has a greater ecosystem diversity than a Scandinavian country like Norway. It has taken millions of years of evolution, to accumulate this rich diversity in nature, but we could lose all that wealth in less than two centuries if the present rates of species losses continue. Biodiversity and its conservation are now vital environmental issues of international concern as more and more people around the world begin to realise the critical importance of biodiversity for our survival and well- being on this planet. 15.1.1 How Many Species are there on Earth and How Many in India? Since there are published records of all the species discovered and named, we know how many species in all have been recorded so far, but it is not easy to answer the question of how many species there are on earth. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (2004), the total number of plant and animal species described so far is slightly more than 1.5 million, but we have no clear idea of how many species are yet to be discovered and described. Estimates vary widely and many of them are only educated guesses. For many taxonomic groups, species inventories are more complete in temperate than in tropical countries. Considering that an overwhelmingly large proportion of the species waiting to be discovered are in the tropics, biologists make a statistical comparison of the temperate-tropical species richness of an exhaustively studied group of insects and extrapolate this ratio to other groups of animals and plants to come up with a gross estimate of the total number of species on earth. Some extreme estimates range from 20 to 50 million, but a more conservative and scientiﬁcally sound estimate made by Robert May places the global species diversity at about 7 million. 2019—2020",1

This was generated using information on polymorphism of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, and some repetitive DNA sequences known as microsatellites (one of the applications of polymorphism in repetitive DNA sequences shall be explained in next section of DNA ﬁngerprinting). 6.9. 1 Salient Features of Human Genome Some of the salient observations drawn from human genome project are as follows: (i) The human genome contains 3 164.7 million bp. (ii) The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly, with the largest known human gene being dystrophin at 2 .4 million bases. (iii) The total number of genes is estimated at 30,000—much lower than previous estimates of 80,000 to 1,40,000 genes. Almost all (99.9 per cent) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people. (iv) The functions are unknown for over 50 per cent of the discovered genes. (v) Less than 2 per cent of the genome codes for proteins. (vi) Repeated sequences make up very large portion of the human genome. (vii) Repetitive sequences are stretches of DNA sequences that are repeated many times, sometimes hundred to thousand times. They are thought to have no direct coding functions, but they shed light on chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution. (viii) Chromosome 1 has most genes (2968), and the Y has the fewest (23 1). (ix) Scientists have identiﬁed about 1.4 million locations where single- base DNA differences (SNPs — single nucleotide polymorphism, pronounced as ‘snips’) occur in humans. This information promises to revolutionise the processes of ﬁnding chromosomal locations for disease-associated sequences and tracing human history. 6.9.2 Applications and Future Challenges Deriving meaningful knowledge from the DNA sequences will deﬁne research through the coming decades leading to our understanding of biological systems. This enormous task will require the expertise and creativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied disciplines in both the public and private sectors worldwide.

They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long as they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the situation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no current thereafter. We can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are supplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by electrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady electric ﬁeld in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous current rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms, 1/ which maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall / study later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady A current that results from a steady electric field in conductors. 3.4 OHM’s LAW A basic law regarding ﬂow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in 1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for ﬂow of currents was discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is ﬂowing and let Vbe the potential difference between the ends of the conductor. Then Ohm’s law states that Vo<I or, V=RI (3.3) where the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the conductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol 2;: £2. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor but also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the dimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows. FIGURE 3.2 Consider a conductor satisfying Eq.

(iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency v, or wavelength A, have the same energy E (=hv = hc/ﬂ.) and momentum p (= hv/c= h/l), whatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having the same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of radiation. (iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deﬂected by electric and magnetic ﬁelds. (v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the total energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number of photons may not be conserved in a collision.

1008,846,"ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CNG burns most efﬁciently, unlike petrol or diesel, in the automobiles and very little of it is left unburnt. Moreover, CNG is cheaper than petrol or diesel, cannot be siphoned off by thieves and adulterated like petrol or diesel. The main problem with switching over to CNG is the difﬁculty of laying down pipelines to deliver CNG through distribution points/ pumps and ensuring uninterrupted supply. Simultaneously parallel steps taken in Delhi for reducing vehicular pollution include phasing out of old vehicles, use of unleaded petrol, use of low-sulphur petrol and diesel, use of catalytic converters in vehicles, application of stringent pollution-level norms for vehicles, etc. The Government of India through a new auto fuel policy has laid out a roadmap to cut down vehicular pollution in Indian cities. More stringent norms for fuels means steadily reducing the sulphur and aromatic content in petrol and diesel fuels. Euro III norms, for example, stipulate that sulphur be controlled at 350 parts-per-million (ppm) in diesel and 150 ppm in petrol. Aromatic hydrocarbons are to be contained at 42 per cent of the concerned fuel. The goal, according to the roadmap, is to reduce sulphur to 50 ppm in petrol and diesel and bring down the level to 35 per cent. Corresponding to the fuel, vehicle engines will also need to be upgraded. Mass Emission Standards (Bharat Stage II which is equivalent to Euro-II norms) are no more applicable in any of the cities of India. Details of the latest Mass Emission Standards in India are provided below (Table 16.1) Table 16.1: Table Showing the Mass Emission Standards in India | Type of Vehicles Norms Cities of Implementation I 4 Wheelers Bharat Stage IV Throughout the country since April 201 7 3 Wheelers Bharat Stage IV Throughout the country since 1st April 201 7 2 Wheelers Bharat Stage IV Throughout the country since April 201 7 Thanks to the efforts made, the air quality of Delhi has signiﬁcantly improved.

What happens in each case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced? Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor. the capacitor gets charged and after charging no current ﬂows in the circuit and the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced. With ac source. the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (l/(DC) and the current ﬂows in the circuit. Consequently. the lamp will shine. Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly than before. Example 7.4 A 15.0 tlF capacitor is connected to a 220 V. 50 HZ source.

1011,1351,"ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS present on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the form of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles there are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute medullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring ; the ‘ring’ arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem. Each vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A large number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular spaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the pith. 6.3.4 Monocotyledonous Stem The monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number of scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous bundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue (Figure 6.7b). Vascular bundles are conjoint and closed. Peripheral vascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones. The phloem parenchyma is absent, and water-containing cavities are present within the vascular bundles. 6.3.5 Dorsiventral (Dicotyledonous) Leaf The vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf through the lamina shows three main parts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. The epidermis which covers both the upper surface (adaxial epidermis) and lower surface (abaxial epidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous cuticle. The abaXial epidermis generally bears more stomata than the adaxial epidermis. The latter may even lack stomata. The tissue between the upper and the lower epidermis is called the mesophyll. Mesophyll, which possesses chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, is made up of parenchyma. It has two types of cells — the palisade parenchyma and the spongy parenchyma. The adaxially placed palisade parenchyma is made up of elongated cells, which are arranged vertically and parallel to each other. The oval or round and loosely arranged spongy parenchyma is situated below the palisade cells and extends to the lower epidermis. There are numerous large spaces and air cavities between these cells. Vascular system includes vascular bundles, which can be seen in the veins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles are dependent on the size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the reticulate venation of the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of thick walled bundle sheath cells. Look at Figure 6.8 (a) and ﬁnd the position of xylem in the vascular bundle. 6.3.6 Isobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf The anatomy of isobilateral leaf is similar to that of the dorsiventral leaf in many ways.

1014,1023,"HUMAN REPRODUCTION SUMMARY Humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The male reproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex accessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each seminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. The spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation, while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig cells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular hormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis. The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair of oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of mammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and some steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different stages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus and vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers namely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female external genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female secondary sexual characteristics. Spermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are transported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm is composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of formation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The reproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty). During ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The cyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones. After coitus, sperms are transported to the junction of the isthmus and ampulla, where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote. The presence of X or Y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo. The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst, which is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy. After nine months of pregnancy, the fully developed foetus is ready for delivery. The process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol, estrogens and oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete milk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the mother (lactation) during the initial few months of growth. l.

We shall denote CP by ri and not by r, as we did earlier. Thus, a) x r is a vector of magnitude (ori and is along the tangent to the circle described by the particle at P. The linear velocity vector v at P has the same magnitude and direction. Thus, v = a) x r (7.20) In fact, the relation, Eq. (7 .20), holds good even for rotation of a rigid body with one point fixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 7 .6(a)]. In this case r represents the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed point taken as the origin. We note that for rotation about a ﬁxed axis, the direction of the vector a) does not change with time. Its magnitude may, however, change from instant to instant. For the more general rotation, both the magnitude and the direction of mmay change from instant to instant. 7.6. 1 Angular acceleration You may have noticed that we are developing the study of rotational motion along the lines of the study of translational motion with which we are already familiar. Analogous to the kinetic variables of linear displacement (s) and velocity (v) in translational motion, we have angular displacement (0) and angular velocity (0)) in rotational motion. It is then natural to define in rotational motion the concept of angular acceleration in analogy with linear acceleration defined as the time rate of change of velocity in translational motion. We define angular acceleration a as the time rate of change of angular velocity; Thus, _dm “—5 (7.21) 2019-20 If the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction of a) and hence, that of a is fixed. In this case the vector equation reduces to a scalar equation _da) a_ _ dt (7.22) 7.7 TORQUE AND AN GUIAR MOMENTUM In this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with two physical quantities (torque and angular momentum) which are deﬁned as vector products of two vectors. These as we shall see, are especially important in the discussion of motion of systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies. 7.7.1 Moment of force (Torque) We have learnt that the motion of a rigid body, in general, is a combination of rotation and translation. If the body is fixed at a point or along a line, it has only rotational motion. We know that force is needed to change the translational state of a body, i.e. to produce linear acceleration. We may then ask, what is the analogue of force in the case of rotational motion? To look into the question in a concrete situation let us take the example of opening or closing of a door. A door is a rigid body which can rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing through the hinges. What makes the door rotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied the door does not rotate. But any force does not do the job. A force applied to the hinge line cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a force of given magnitude applied at right angles to the door at its outer edge is most effective in producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but how and where the force is applied is important in rotational motion. The rotational analogue of force in linear motion is moment of force. It is also referred to as torque or couple. (We shall use the words moment of force and torque interchangeably.) We shall first define the moment of force for the special case of a single particle. Later on we shall extend the concept to systems of particles including rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to a change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is angular acceleration of a rigid body.",0

Effective counselling on the need to avoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions as well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the mentioned unhealthy trend. 4.4 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIs) Infections or diseases which are transmitted through sexual intercourse are collectively called sexually transmitted infections (STI) or venereal diseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Gonorrhoea, syphilis, genital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B and of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading to AIDS are some of the common STIs. Among these, HIV infection is most dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 8. Some of these infections like hepatitis—B and HIV can also be transmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments, etc., with infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to the foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections, other diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated properly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching, ﬂuid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc., in the genital region. Infected females may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected for long. Absence or less signiﬁcant symptoms in the early stages of infection and the social stigma attached to the STIs, deter the infected persons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could lead to complications later, which include pelvic inﬂammatory diseases (PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer of the reproductive tract. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society. Therefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are given prime consideration under the reproductive health-care programmes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their incidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group of 15-24 years — the age group to which you also belong. There is no reason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these infections by following the simple principles given below: (i) Avoid sex with unknown partners / multiple partners. (ii) Always try to use condoms during coitus. (iii) In case of doubt, one should go to a qualiﬁed doctor for early detection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection. 4. 5 INFERTILITY A discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of infertility.

These allow large quantities of data to be transmitted rapidly, securely, and are virtually error-free. With the digitisation of information in the 1990s, telecommunication slowly merged with computers to form integrated networks termed as Internet. Satellite Communication Today Internet is the largest electronic network on the planet connecting about 1,000 million people in more than 100 countries. Satellites touch human lives in many ways. Every time you use a cell phone to call a friend, send an SMS or watch a popular programme on cable television. You are using satellite communication. Communication through satellites emerged as a new area in communication technology since the 1970s after U.S.A. and former U.S.S.R. pioneered space research. Artificial satellites, now, are successfully deployed in the earth’s orbit to connect even the remote corners of the globe with limited on- site verification. These have rendered the unit cost and time of communication invariant in terms of distance. This means it costs the same to communicate over 500 km as it does over 5,000 km via satellite. India has also made great strides in satellite development. Aryabhatt was launched on 19 April 1979, Bhaskar-I in 1979 and Rohini in 1980. On 18 June 1981, APPLE (Arian Passenger Payload Experiment) was launched through Arian rocket. Bhaskar, Challenger and INSAT I-B have made long- distance communication, television and radio very effective. Today weather forecasting through television is a boon. Cyber Space - Internet Cyberspace is the world of electronic computerised space. It is encompassed by the Internet such as the World Wide Web (www). In simple words, it is the electronic digital world for communicating or accessing information over computer networks without physical movement of the sender and the receiver... It is also referred to as the Internet. Cyberspace exists everywhere. It may be in an office, sailing boat, ﬂying plane and virtually anywhere. The speed at which this electronic network has spread is unprecedented in human history. There were less than 50 million Internet users in 1995, about 400 million in 2000 AD. and over two billion in 20 10. In the last few years there has been a shift among global users from U.S.A. to the developing countries. The percentage share of U.S.A. has dropped from 66 in 1995 to only 25 in 2005. Now the majority of the world’s users are in U.S.A., U.K., Germany, Japan, China and India. As billions use the Internet each year, cyberspace will expand the contemporary economic and social space of humans through e-mail, e-commerce, e-learning and e-governance. Internet together with fax, television and radio will be accessible to more and more people cutting across place and time. It is these modern communication systems, more than transportation, that has made the concept of global village a reality. Afriiijl/lif’§§i'i.iz<l, 2019-20",2

Such currents occur naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges ﬂow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results. The ﬂow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges ﬂow in a steady manner, like water ﬂowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents. 3.2 ELECTRIC CURRENT Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of ﬂow of charges. Both the positive and the negative charges may ﬂow forward and backward across the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount (i.e., forward minus backward) of positive charge that ﬂows in the forward direction across the area. Similarly, let q_ be the net amount of negative charge ﬂowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount of charge ﬂowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval t, then, is q = q+— q_. This is proportional to tfor steady current 2019-20",0

Thus, change in its potential energy AUpot is AUpot = Final potential energy — Initial potential energy = AQ[(V(B) - V(AH = -AQ V = —I VAt < O (3.28) If charges moved without collisions through the conductor, their kinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged. Conservation of total energy would then imply that, AK= —AUPot (3.29) that is, AK = I VAt > O (3.30) Thus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under the action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they move. We have, however, seen earlier that on the average, charge carriers do not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is because of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During collisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms. The atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus, in an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the conductor during the time interval At is, AW= IVAt (3.31) The energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated P = AW/At and we have, P = I V (3.32) Using Ohm’s law V = IR, we get P= 12R: V2/R (3.33) as the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a current I.

1024,982,"PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION Sutton and Boveri argued that the pairing and separation of a pair of chromosomes would lead to the segregation of a pair of factors they carried. Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal segregation with Mendelian principles and called it the chromosomal theory of inheritance. Following this synthesis of ideas, experimental verification of the chromosomal theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues, led to discovering the basis for the variation fruit ﬂies, Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 5.10), which were found very suitable for such studies. They could be grown on simple synthetic medium in the laboratory. They complete their life cycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large number of progeny ﬂies. Also, there was a clear differentiation of the sexes — the male and female ﬂies are easily distinguishable. Also, it has many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low power microscopes. 5.3.3 Linkage and Recombination Morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes that were sex-linked. ’Ihe crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried out by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied, white-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their F1 progeny. He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently of each other and the F2 ratio deviated very signiﬁcantly from the 913:3: 1 ratio (expected when the two genes are independent). Morgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X chromosome (Section 5.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 5.1 1). Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed very low recombination) (Figure 5.1 1, Cross A) while others were loosely linked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 5.1 1, Cross B). For example he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked and showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white and miniature wing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome.

1025,1395,"HERBERT BOYER (1936 ) Herbert Boyer was born in 1936 and brought up in a corner of western Pennsylvania where railroads and mines were the destiny of most young men. He completed graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, in 1963, followed by three years of post—graduate studies at Yale. In 1966, Boyer took over assistant professorship at the University of California at San Francisco. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple of restriction enzymes of the E. coli bacterium with especially useful properties. Boyer observed that these enzymes have the capability of cutting DNA strands in a particular fashion, which left what has became known as ‘sticky ends’ on the strands. These clipped ends made pasting together pieces of DNA a precise exercise. This discovery, in turn, led to a rich and rewarding conversation in Hawaii with a Stanford scientist named Stanley Cohen. Cohen had been studying small ringlets of DNA called plasmids and which float about freely in the cytoplasm of certain bacterial cells and replicate independently from the coding strand of DNA. Cohen had developed a method of removing these plasmids from the cell and then reinserting them in other cells. Combining this process with that of DNA splicing enabled Boyer and Cohen to recombine segments of DNA in desired configurations and insert the DNA in bacterial cells, which could then act as manufacturing plants for specific proteins. This breakthrough was the basis upon which the discipline of biotechnology was founded. 2019-2020",1
1026,273,"WORK. ENERGY AND POWER 117 The work done by the force is deﬁned to be the product of component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement. Thus W= (Fcos 0)d= Rd (6.4) We see that if there is no displacement, there is no work done even if the force is large. Thus, when you push hard against a rigid brick wall, the force you exert on the wall does no work. Yet your muscles are alternatively contracting and relaxing and internal energy is being used up and you do get tired. Thus, the meaning of work in physics is different from its usage in everyday language. No work is done if : (i) the displacement is zero as seen in the example above. A weightlifter holding a 150 kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s does no work on the load during this time. (ii) the force is zero. A block moving on a smooth horizontal table is not acted upon by a horizontal force (since there is no friction), but may undergo a large displacement. (iii) the force and displacement are mutually perpendicular. This is so since, for 6 = 7c / 2 rad (= 90""), cos (TC/2) = 0. For the block moving on a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational force mg does no work since it acts at right angles to the displacement. If we assume that the moon’s orbits around the earth is perfectly circular then the earth’s gravitational force does no work. The moon’s instantaneous displacement is tangential while the earth’s force is radially inwards and 0 = 7t / 2. Work can be both positive and negative. If 0 is between 00 and 90°, cos 0 in Eq. (6.4) is positive. If 0 is between 900 and 1800, cos 0 is negative. In many examples the frictional force opposes displacement and 0 = 180”. Then the work done by friction is negative (cos 1800 = —1). From Eq. (6.4) it is clear that work and energy have the same dimensions, [ML2T2]. The SI unit of these is joule (J), named after the famous British physicist James Prescott Joule (1 8 1 1- 1 869). Since work and energy are so widely used as physical concepts, alternative units abound and some of these are listed in Table 6. 1.

During this process. the force on the cycle due to the road is 200 N and is directly opposed to the motion. (a) How much work does the road do on the cycle ‘? (b) How much work does the cycle do on the road ? Answer Work done on the cycle by the road is the work done by the stopping (frictional) force on the cycle due to the road. (a) The stopping force and the displacement make an angle of 180° (7: rad) with each other. Thus, work done by the road, Wr= chosO = 200x 10><cos7c = — 2000 J It is this negative work that brings the cycle to a halt in accordance with WE theorem. (b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and opposite force acts on the road due to the cycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the road undergoes no displacement. Thus, work done by cycle on the road is zero. 4 The lesson of Example 6.3 is that though the force on a body A exerted by the body B is always equal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s Third Law); the work done on A by B is not necessarily equal and opposite to the work done on B by A. 6.4 KINETIC ENERGY As noted earlier, if an object of mass m has velocity v, its kinetic energy K is 1 1 2 K = —mv.v = —mv _ 2 2 (6 5) Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.

1027,809,"BIOLOGY Mammals from colder climates generally have shorter ears and limbs to minimise heat loss. (This is called the Allen’s Rule.) In the polar seas aquatic mammals like seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) below their skin that acts as an insulator and reduces loss of body heat. Some organisms possess adaptations that are physiological which allow them to respond quickly to a stressful situation. If you had ever been to any high altitude place (>3,500m Rohtang Pass near Manali and Leh you must have experienced what is called altitude sickness. Its symptoms include nausea, fatigue and heart palpitations. This is because in the low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, the body does not get enough oxygen. But, gradually you get acclimatised and stop experiencing altitude sickness. How did your body solve this problem? The body compensates low oxygen availability by increasing red blood cell production, decreasing the binding affinity of hemoglobin and by increasing breathing rate. Many tribes live in the high altitude of Himalayas. Find out if they normally have a higher red blood cell count (or total hemoglobin) than people living in the plains. In most animals, the metabolic reactions and hence all the physiological functions proceed optimally in a narrow temperature range (in humans, it is 37 OC). But there are microbes (archaebacteria) that ﬂourish in hot springs and deep sea hydrothermal vents where temperatures far exceed 100°C. How is this possible? Many ﬁsh thrive in Antarctic waters where the temperature is always below zero. How do they manage to prevent their body ﬂuids from freezing? A large variety of marine invertebrates and ﬁsh live at great depths in the ocean where the pressure could be > 100 times the normal atmospheric pressure that we experience. How do they live under such high pressures and do they have any special enzymes? Organisms living in such extreme environments show a fascinating array of biochemical adaptations. Some organisms show behavioural responses to cope up with variations in their environment. Desert lizards lack the physiological ability that mammals have to deal with the high temperatures of their habitat, but manage to keep their body temperature fairly constant by behavioural means. They bask in the sun and absorb heat when their body temperature drops below the comfort zone, but move into shade when the ambient temperature starts increasing. Some species are capable of burrowing into the soil to hide and escape from the above-ground heat. 13.2 POPULATIONS 13.2. 1 Population Attributes In nature, we rarely ﬁnd isolated, single individuals of any species; majority of them live in groups in a well deﬁned geographical area, share or compete for similar resources, potentially interbreed and thus constitute a population.

The —’|W|‘— effective barrier height under forward bias is (VO — V). g: If the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be P g: n reduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a as small number of carriers in the material—those that happen to be in the uppermost energy levels—will possess enough energy to cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase (a) the applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced and more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus the current increases. V0 Due to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the depletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority carries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach (b) the n—side (where they are minority carries). This process under forward bias is known as minority carrier injection. At the junction boundary, on each side, the minority carrier concentration increases significantly compared to the locations far from the junction. Due to this concentration gradient, the injected electrons on p-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end of p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the OONh—I FIGURE 14.13 (a) p—n junction diode under forward bias, (b) Barrier potential (1) without battery.

The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same as the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases and the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field. The effective barrier height under reverse bias is (V0 + V), [Fig. 14.15(b)]. This suppresses the ﬂow of electrons from n —> p and holes from p a n. Thus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode under forward bias. The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on p-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the junction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers gives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few uA. This is quite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority side to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also there under forward bias but it is negligible (uA) when compared with current due to injected carriers which is usually in mA. The diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied voltage.

Such everyday experiences convince us that both the force and its coverage area are important. Smaller the area on which the force acts, greater is the impact. This impact is known as pressure. When an object is submerged in a ﬂuid at rest, the ﬂuid exerts a force on its surface. This force is always normal to the object’s surface. This is so because if there were a component of force parallel to the surface, the object will also exert a force on the ﬂuid parallel to it; as a consequence of Newton’s third law. This force will cause the ﬂuid to ﬂow parallel to the surface. Since the ﬂuid is at rest, this cannot happen. Hence, the force exerted by the ﬂuid at rest has to be perpendicular to the surface in contact with it. This is shown in Fig. 10.1(a). The normal force exerted by the ﬂuid at a point may be measured. An idealised form of one such pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig. 10. 1 (b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with a spring that is calibrated to measure the force acting on the piston. This device is placed at a point inside the ﬂuid. The inward force exerted by the ﬂuid on the piston is balanced by the outward spring force and is thereby measured.

We remind the reader that it is the component of the force normal to the area under consideration and not the (vector) force that appears in the numerator in Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2). Its dimensions are [ML—1T2]. The S1 unit of pressure is N m‘2. It has been named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the French scientist Blaise Pascal (1623- 1662) who carried out pioneering studies on ﬂuid pressure. A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere (atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 x 105 Pa). Another quantity, that is indispensable in describing ﬂuids, is the density p. For a ﬂuid of mass m occupying volume V, —2- now p—V - The dimensions of density are [ML—3]. Its SI unit is kg m‘3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A liquid is largely incompressible and its density is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures. Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large variation in densities with pressure. The density of water at 4°C (277 K) is 1.0 x 103 kg m‘3. The relative density of a substance is the ratio of its density to the density of water at 4°C. It is a dimensionless positive scalar quantity. For example the relative density of aluminium is 2.7.

It is the cell theory that emphasised the unity underlying this diversity of fonns, i.e., the cellular organisation of all life forms. A description of cell structure and cell growth by division is given in the chapters comprising this unit. Cell theory also created a sense of mystery around living phenomena, i.e., physiological and behavioural processes. This mystery was the requirement of integrity of cellular organisation for living phenomena to be demonstrated or observed. In studying and understanding the physiological and behavioural processes, one can take a physico-chemical approach and use cell-free systems to investigate. This approach enables us to describe the various processes in molecular terms. The approach is established by analysis of living tissues for elements and compounds. It will tell us what types of organic compounds are present in living organisms. In the next stage, one can ask the question: What are these compounds doing inside a cell? And, in what way they carry out gross physiological processes like digestion, excretion, memory, defense, recognition, etc. In other words we answer the question, what is the molecular basis of all physiological processes?

Neglect air resistance. Answer An object released near the surface of the Earth is accelerated downward under the inﬂuence of the force of gravity. The magnitude of acceleration due to gravity is represented by g. If air resistance is neglected, the object is said to be in free fall. If the height through which the object falls is small compared to the earth’s radius, 9 can be taken to be constant, equal to 9.8 m S‘Z. Free fall is thus a case of motion with uniform acceleration. We assume that the motion is in y-direction, more correctly in —y-direction because we choose upward direction as positive. Since the acceleration due to gravity is always downward, it is in the negative direction and we have a=—g =—9.8er2 The object is released from rest at y = 0.

1034,1031,"186 BIOLOGY ﬁlaments form a network around the young root or they penetrate the root cells. The hyphae have a very large surface area that absorb mineral ions and water from the soil from a much larger volume of soil that perhaps a root cannot do. The fungus provides minerals and water to the roots, in turn the roots provide sugars and N-containing compounds to the mycorrhizae. Some plants have an obligate association with the mycorrhizae. For example, Pinus seeds cannot germinate and establish without the presence of mycorrhizae. 1 1.3.2 Water Movement up a Plant We looked at how plants absorb water from the soil, and move it into the vascular tissues. We now have to try and understand how this water is transported to various parts of the plant. Is the water movement active, or is it still passive? Since the water has to be moved up a stem against gravity, what provides the energy for this? 1 1 .3.2.1 Root Pressure As various ions from the soil are actively transported into the vascular tissues of the roots, water follows (its potential gradient) and increases the pressure inside the xylem. This positive pressure is called root pressure, and can be responsible for pushing up water to small heights in the stem. How can we see that root pressure exists? Choose a small soft-stemmed plant and on a day, when there is plenty of atmospheric moisture, cut the stem horizontally near the base with a sharp blade, early in the morning. You will soon see drops of solution ooze out of the cut stem; this comes out due to the positive root pressure. If you ﬁx a rubber tube to the cut stem as a sleeve you can actually collect and measure the rate of exudation, and also determine the composition of the exudates. Effects of root pressure is also observable at night and early morning when evaporation is low, and excess water collects in the form of droplets around special openings of veins near the tip of grass blades, and leaves of many herbaceous parts. Such water loss in its liquid phase is known as guttation. Root pressure can, at best, only provide a modest push in the overall process of water transport. They obviously do not play a major role in water movement up tall trees. The greatest contribution of root pressure may be to re-establish the continuous chains of water molecules in the xylem which often break under the enormous tensions created by transpiration.

To reduce the number of unknowns at the outset, the ﬁrst rule of Kirchhoff is used at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.

The bridge has four resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4. Across one pair of diagonally opposite points (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (i.e., AC) is called the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a galvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This line, shown as BD in the ﬁgure, is called the galvanometer arm. For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In general there will be currents ﬂowing across all the resistors as well as a current I g through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge where the resistors are such that I g = 0. We can easily get the balance condition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the Kirchhoffs junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure) 2019-20",0

1037,1008,"MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE phosphate moiety at 5,-end of sugar, which is referred to as 5’-end of polynucleotide chain. Similarly, at the other end of the polymer the sugar has a free OH of 3C group which is referred to as 3’ - end of the polynucleotide chain. The backbone of a polynucleotide chain is formed due to sugar and phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from the backbone (Figure 6.1). In RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional —OH group present at 2,-position in the ribose. Also, in RNA the uracil is found at the place of thymine (5-methyl uracil, another chemical name for thymine). DNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Friedrich Meischer in 1 869. He named it as ‘Nuclein’. However, due to technical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact, the elucidation of structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period of time. It was only in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X—ray diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, proposed a very simple but famous Double Helix model for the structure of DNA One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between the two strands of polynucleotide chains. However, this proposition was also based on the observation of Erwin Chargaff that for a double stranded DNA, the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine are constant and equals one. The base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide chains. They are said to be complementary to each other, and therefore if the sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other strand can be predicted. Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a parental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two double stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced would be identical to the parental DNA molecule. Because of this, the genetic implications of the structure of DNA became very clear. The salient features of the Double-helix structure of DNA are as follows: (i) It is made of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate, and the bases project inside. (ii) The two chains have anti-parallel polarity. It means, if one chain has the polarity 593', the other has 395'. (iii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond (H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with Thymine from opposite strand and Vice-versa. Similarly, Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds. As a result, always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This generates approximately uniform distance between the two strands of the helix (Figure 6.2). (iv) The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch of the helix is 3.4 nm (a nanometre is one billionth of a metre, that is 10“9 m) and there are roughly 10 bp in each 2019-2020 97",1
1038,861,"250 BIOLOGY leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot formation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote nutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence. 1 5.4.3.4 Ethylene Ethylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Inﬂuences of ethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and ﬂowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the respiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of respiration is called respiratory climactic. Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid internode / petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves / upper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase their absorption surface. Ethylene is used to initiate ﬂowering and for synchronising fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces ﬂowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is ethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and transported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission in ﬂowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female ﬂowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield. 1 5.4.3.5 Abscisic acid As mentioned earlier, abscisic acid (ABA) was discovered for its role in regulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has other wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a general plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism. ABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata and increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses. Therefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important role in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing dormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors unfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist to GAs. We may summarise that for any and every phase of growth, differentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some role to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These could be individualistic or synergistic.",1

Under this situation the spring on the left side gets Fig. 14.15 elongated by a length equal to x and that on the right side gets compressed by the same length. The forces acting on the mass are then, F1 = —kx (force exerted by the spring on the left side, trying to pull the mass towards the mean position) F2 = —kx (force exerted by the spring on the right side, trying to push the mass towards the mean position) The net force, F, acting on the mass is then given by, F =—2kx Hence the force acting on the mass is proportional to the displacement and is directed towards the mean position; therefore, the motion executed by the mass is simple harmonic.

In section 14.5 we have seen that the velocity of a particle executing SHM, is a periodic function of time. It is zero at the extreme positions of displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (K) of such a particle, which is defined as K=lmv2 2 = g m (02A2 sin2(a)t + ¢) =ékA2sin2(wt+¢) (14.15) is also a periodic function of time, being zero when the displacement is maximum and maximum when the particle is at the mean position. Note, since the sign of v is immaterial in K, the period of K is T/ 2. What is the potential energy (U) of a particle executing simple harmonic motion? In Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of potential energy is possible only for conservative forces. The spring force F = —kx is a conservative force, with associated potential energy 1 U=§kx2 (14.16) Hence the potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is, U(x) = l kx2 2 =ékA2c052(a)t+¢) (14.17) Thus, the potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is also periodic, with period T/ 2, being zero at the mean position and maximum at the extreme displacements.",0

We must, however, recognise that though our ancestors knew about the inheritance of characters and variation, they had very little idea about the scientiﬁc basis of these phenomena. 5. 1 MENDEL’S LAWS OF INHERITANCE It was during the mid-nineteenth century that headway was made in the understanding of inheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted hybridisation experiments on garden peas for seven years (1856- 1863) and proposed the laws of inheritance in living organisms. During Mendel’s investigations into inheritance patterns it was for the ﬁrst time that statistical analysis and mathematical logic were applied to problems in biology. His experiments had a large sampling size, which gave greater credibility to the data that he collected. Also, the confirmation of his inferences from experiments on successive generations of his test plants, proved that his results pointed to general rules of inheritance rather than being unsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated characters in the garden pea plant that were manifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or dwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This allowed him to set up a basic framework of rules governing inheritance, which was expanded on by later scientists to account for all the diverse natural observations and the complexity inherent in them. Mendel conducted such artificial pollination / cross pollination experiments using several true-breeding pea lines. A true- breeding line is one that, having undergone continuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and expression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with contrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or wrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inﬂated (full) or constricted green or yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 5.1, Table 5.1). 2019—2020",1

While oceanic routes connect different countries, coastal shipping is a convenient mode of transportation with long coastlines, e.g. USA, China and India. Shenzhen States in Europe are most suitably placed for coastal shipping connecting one member’s coast with the other.

For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb’s law for two charges stated earlier. The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the force on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by the magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has a magnitude | q | /4nsor2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive, and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field also satisﬁes superposition principle. An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly spaced parallel straight lines. Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are continuous curves without any breaks. [ii] Two field lines cannot cross each other.

1048,1398,"BIOLOGY sexual co-habitation. The reasons for this could be many—physical, congenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological. In India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but more often than not, the problem lies in the male partner. Specialised health care units (infertility clinics, etc.) could help in diagnosis and corrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to have children. However, where such corrections are not possible, the couples could be assisted to have children through certain special techniques commonly known as assisted reproductive technologies (ART). In vitro fertilisation (NF—fertilisation outside the body in almost similar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET) is one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as test tube baby programme, ova from the wife / donor (female) and sperms from the husband / donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under simulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with upto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube (ZIFT—zygote intra fallopian transfer) and embryos with more than 8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT - intra uterine transfer), to complete its further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation (fusion of gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist those females who cannot conceive. Transfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube (GIFT — gamete intra fallopian transfer) of another female who cannot produce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and further development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection UCSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo in the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum. Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate the female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be corrected by artificial insemination (AI) technique. In this technique, the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artiﬁcially introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI — intra—uterine insemination) of the female. Though options are many, all these techniques require extremely high precision handling by specialised professionals and expensive instrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only in very few centres in the country. Obviously their beneﬁts is affordable to only a limited number of people. Emotional, religious and social factors are also deterrents in the adoption of these methods. Since the ultimate aim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many orphaned and destitute children, who would probably not survive till maturity, unless taken care of. Our laws permit legal adoption and it is as yet, one of the best methods for couples looking for parenthood. 2019-2020",1

SUMMARY Plants unlike animals have no special systems for breathing or gaseous exchange. Stomata and lenticels allow gaseous exchange by diffusion. Almost all living cells in a plant have their surfaces exposed to air. The breaking of C- C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cells leading to the release of a lot of ener‘r is called cellular respiration. Glucose 1s the favoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to yield energy. The initial stage'z'of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm. Each glucose moleculefisbmken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions into two molecules of pyruVic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the pyruvate depends‘on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobic conditions eithei‘r, lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of C02. Acetyl CoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid pathway or Krebs’ cycle operating in the matrix of the mitochondria. NADH + H’“ and FADH2 are generated in the Krebs’ cycle. The energy in these molecules as well as that in the NADH + H” synthesised during glycolysis are used to synthesise ATP. This is accomplished through a 237",1

The co-efﬁcient of static friction between the tyres and the road is 0.]. Will the cyclist slip while taking the turn? Answer On an unbanked road, frictional force alone can provide the centripetal force needed to keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn without slipping. If the speed is too large, or if the turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius) or both, the frictional force is not sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force, and the cyclist slips. The condition for the cyclist not to slip is given by Eq. (5.18) : v2 S 1,1ng Now, R = 3 m, g = 9.8 m s2, us = 0.1. That is, us R9 = 2.94 m2 s2. 1) = 18 km/h = 5 m S'l,‘ i.e., v2 = 25 m2 s2.

You should now be able to handle a large variety of problems in mechanics. A typical problem in mechanics usually does not merely involve a single body under the action of given forces. More often, we will need to consider an assembly of different bodies exerting forces on each other. Besides, each body in the assembly experiences the force of gravity. When trying to solve a problem of this type, it is useful to remember the fact that we can choose any part of the assembly and apply the laws of motion to that part provided we include all forces on the chosen part due to the remaining parts of the assembly. We may call the chosen part of the assembly as the system and the remaining part of the assembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as the environment. We have followed the same 2019-20",0

In Russia, railways account for about 90 per cent of the country’s total transport with a very dense network west of the Urals. Moscow is the most important rail head with major lines radiating to different parts of the country’s vast geographical area. Underground railways and commuter trains are also important in Moscow. North America has one of the most extensive rail networks accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the world’s total? In contrast to many European countries, the railways are used more for long-distance bulky freight like ores, grains, timber and machinery than for passengers. The most dense rail network is found in the highly industrialised and urbanised region of East Central U.S.A. and adjoining Canada. In Canada, railways are in the public sector and distributed all over the sparsely populated areas. The transcontinental railways carry the bulk of wheat and coal tonnage. Australia has about 40, 000 km of railways, of which 25 per cent are found in New South Wales alone. The west-east Australian National Railway line runs across the country from Perth to Sydney. New Zealand’s railways are mainly in the North Island to serve the farming areas. In South America, the rail network is the most dense in two regions, namely, the Pampas of Argentina and the coffee growing region of Brazil which together account for 40 per cent of South America’s total route length. Only Chile, among the remaining countries has a considerable route length linking coastal centres with the mining sites in the interior. Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela have short single-track rail-lines from ports to the interior with no inter-connecting links. There is only one trans-continental rail route linking Buenos Aires (Argentina) with Valparaiso (Chile) across the Andes Mountains through the Uspallatta Pass located at a height of 3,900 m. In Asia, rail network is the most dense in the thickly populated areas of Japan, China and India. Other countries have relatively few rail routes. West Asia is the least developed in rail facilities because of vast deserts and sparsely populated regions. 1):) ‘IFJU KIJU W TRAIN TO TIBET The train Ouinghai-leet train is a marvel that has no predecessor in the past.

It also represents a harmonic motion with the point of equilibrium occurring at 1/2 instead of zero. 4 14.4 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND UNIFORM CIRCUIAR MOTION In this section, we show that the projection of uniform circular motion on a diameter of the circle follows simple harmonic motion. A simple experiment (Fig. 14.9) helps us visualise this connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string and make it move in a horizontal plane about a fixed point with a constant angular speed. The ball would then perform a uniform circular motion in the horizontal plane. Observe the ball sideways or from the front, fixing your attention in the plane of motion. The ball will appear to execute to and fro motion along a horizontal line with the point of rotation as the midpoint. You could alternatively observe the shadow of the ball on a wall which is perpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this process what we are observing is the motion of the ball on a diameter of the circle normal to the direction of viewing. Fig. 1 4.9 Circular motion of a ball in a plane viewed edge—on is SHM. Fig. 14.10 describes the same situation mathematically. Suppose a particle P is moving uniformly on a circle of radius A with angular speed a). The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.

Worms have specialised chemoreceptors (taste receptors) which react to chemical stimuli. These sense organs are located on the anterior part of the worm. Earthworm is hermaphrodite (bisexual), i.e., testes and ovaries are present in the same individual (Figure 7.13). There are two pairs of testes present in the 10th and 1 1th segments. Their vasa deferentia run up to the 1 8th segment where they join the prostatic duct. Two pairs of accessory glands are present one pair each in the 1 7th and 19th segments. The common prostate and spermatic duct (vasa deferentia) opens to the exterior by a pair of male genital pores on the ventro-lateral side of the 18th segment. Four pairs of spermathecae are located in 631-9th segments (one pair in each segment). They receive and store spermatozoa during copulation. One pair of ovaries is attached at the inter-segmental septum of the 12th and 13th segments. Ovarian funnels are present beneath the ovaries which continue into oviduct, join together and open on the ventral side as a single median female genital pore on the 14th segment. A mutual exchange of sperm occurs between two worms during mating. One worm has to ﬁnd another worm and they mate juxtaposing opposite gonadal openings exchanging packets of sperms called spermatophores. Mature sperm and egg cells and nutritive ﬂuid are deposited in cocoons produced by the gland cells of clitellum. Fertilisation and development occur within the cocoons which are deposited in soil. The ova (eggs) are fertilised by the sperm cells within the cocoon which then slips off the worm and is deposited in or on the soil. The cocoon holds the worm embryos. After about 3 weeks, each cocoon produces two to twenty baby worms with an average of four. Development of earthworms is direct, i.e., there is no larva formed. 2019-2020",1

The ﬁsh gets protection from predators which stay away from the stinging tentacles. The anemone does not appear to derive any beneﬁt by hosting the clown ﬁsh. Mutualism: This interaction confers beneﬁts on both the interacting species. Lichens represent an intimate mutualistic relationship between a fungus and photosynthesising algae or cyanobacteria. Similarly, the mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the roots of higher plants. The fungi help the plant in the absorption of essential nutrients from the soil while the plant in turn provides the fungi with energy-yielding carbohydrates. The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships. Plants need the help of animals for pollinating their ﬂowers and dispersing their seeds. Animals obviously have to be paid ‘fees’ for the services that plants expect from them. Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for seed dispersers. But the mutually beneﬁcial system should also be safeguarded against ‘cheaters’, for example, animals that try to steal nectar without aiding in pollination. Now you can see why plant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the mutualists, that is, the evolutions of the ﬂower and its pollinator species are tightly linked with one another. In many species of ﬁg trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp (Figure 13.7). It means that a given ﬁg species can be pollinated only by its ‘partner’ wasp species and no other species. The female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying) site but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing 2019-2020 237",1

(b) due to a charge 7Q. 18 Similarly the total force on charge —q at C is F3 = .5 F 11 , where 11 is the unit vector along the direction bisecting the ABCA. It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges is zero, i.e., F1 + F2 + F3 = 0 The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact that Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof is left to you as an exercise. 1 .8 ELECTRIC FIELD Let us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin 0. If we place another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q will exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If charge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there nothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act when we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the early scientists introduced the concept of ﬁeld. According to this, we say that the charge Q produces an electric ﬁeld everywhere in the surrounding. When another charge q is brought at some point P, the ﬁeld there acts on it and produces a force. The electric ﬁeld produced by the charge Q at a point r is given as 1 Q 1 Q E r = —i‘= —i' ( ) 47:80 r2 47580 r2 (1'6) where i- : r/ r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6) specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position vector 1'. The word “field” signiﬁes how some distributed quantity (which could be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge has been incorporated in the existence of the electric ﬁeld. We obtain the force F exerted by a charge Q on a charge q, as F = 1 9—3 i- 471280 r Note that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the charge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be looked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of Q and vice versa. If we denote the position of charge q by the vector 1', it experiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric ﬁeld E at the location of q. Thus, F(r) = q EM (1 .8) Equation (1.8) defines the 81 unit of electric ﬁeld as N / 0*. Some important remarks may be made here: (i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric ﬁeld due to a charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the electric ﬁeld due to a charge Q at a point in space may be defined as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed (1.7) * An alternate unit V/ m will be introduced in the next chapter. 2019-20",0
1061,827,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Thus, growth, differentiation and development are very closely related events in the life of a plant. Broadly, development is considered as the sum of growth and differentiation. Development in plants (i.e., both growth and differentiation) is under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The former includes both intracellular (genetic) or intercellular factors (chemicals such as plant growth regulators) while the latter includes light, temperature, water, oxygen, nutrition, etc. 15.4 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS 15.4. 1 Characteristics The plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small, simple molecules of diverse chemical composition. They could be indole compounds (indole-3-acetic acid, 1AA); adenine derivatives (Ne-furfurylamino purine, kinetin), derivatives of carotenoids (abscisic acid, ABA); terpenes (gibberellic acid, GA3) or gases (ethylene, CZH4). Plant growth regulators are variously described as plant growth substances, plant hormones or phytohormones in literature. The PGRs can be broadly divided into two groups based on their functions in a living plant body. One group of PGRs are involved in growth promoting activities, such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern formation, tropic growth, ﬂowering, fruiting and seed formation. These are also called plant growth promoters, e.g., auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins. The PGRs of the other group play an important role in plant responses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. They are also involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as dormancy and abscission. ’Ihe PGR abscisic acid belongs to this group. The gaseous PGR, ethylene, could ﬁt either of the groups, but it is largely an inhibitor of grth activities. 15.4.2 The Discovery of Plant Growth Regulators Interestingly, the discovery of each of the ﬁve major groups of PGRs have been accidental. All this started with the observation of Charles Darwin and his son Francis Darwin when they observed that the coleoptiles of canary grass responded to unilateral illumination by growing towards the light source (phototropism). After a series of experiments, it was concluded that the tip of coleoptile was the site of transmittable inﬂuence that caused E] 13 P a b c d 247 the bending of the entire coleoptile (Figure Figure 15.10 Experiment used to demonstrate 1 5. 10).

In a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and charge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant value of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to the other. 5. Electric ﬁeld at the surface of a charged conductor E = —n 80 (2.35) where o is the surface charge density and I1 is a unit vector normal to the surface in the outward direction. To derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian surface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.1 7. The pill box is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It has a small area of cross section (SS and negligible height. Just inside the surface, the electrostatic ﬁeld is zero; just outside, the ﬁeld is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus, the contribution to the total ﬂux through the pill box comes only from the outside (circular) cross-section of the pill box. This equals i E58 (positive for 6 > 0, negative for a < 0), since over the small area 68, E may be considered constant and E and ES are parallel or antiparallel.

Electrostatic shielding Consider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A remarkable result is that the electric ﬁeld inside the cavity is zero, whatever be the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the conductor and the external ﬁelds in which it might be placed. We have proved a simple case of this result already: the electric ﬁeld inside a charged spherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of the spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of electric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned above, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductor 69 2019-20",0

Glycolysis F ennentation Aerobic Respiration The Respiratory Balance Sheet Amphibolic Pathway RespiraIOIy Quotient CHAPTER 1 4 RESPIRATION IN PLANTS All of us breathe to live, but why is breathing so essential to life? What happens when we breathe? Also, do all living organisms, including plants and microbes, breathe? If so, how? All living organisms need energy for carrying out daily life activities, be it absorption, transport, movement, reproduction or even breathing. Where does all this energy come from? We know we eat food for energy — but how is this energy taken from food? How is this energy utilised? Do all foods give the same amount of energy? Do plants ‘eat’? Where do plants get their energy from? And micro-organisms — for their energy requirements, do they eat ‘food’? You may wonder at the several questions raised above — they may seem to be very disconnected. But in reality, the process of breathing is very much connected to the process of release of energy from food. Let us try and understand how this happens. All the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation of some macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Only green plants and cyanobacteria can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesis they trap light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch. We must remember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs photosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often located in the superﬁcial layers, carry out photosynthesis. Hence, even in green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green, need food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non- green parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants 2019-2020",1

We end this section by quoting from the Nobel lecture of Dennis Gabor* The wave nature of light was demonstrated convincingly for the ﬁrst time in 1801 by Thomas Young by a wonderfully simple experiment. He let a ray of sunlight into a dark room, placed a dark screen in front of it, pierced with two small pinholes, and beyond this, at some distance, a white screen. He then saw two darkish lines at both sides of a bright line, which gave him sufficient encouragement to repeat the experiment, this time with spirit flame as light source, with a little salt in it to produce the bright yellow sodium light. This time he saw a number of dark lines, regularly spaced; the first clear proof that light added to light can produce darkness.

Under normal conditions, births and deaths are the most important factors inﬂuencing population density, the other two factors assuming importance only under special conditions. For instance, if a new habitat is just being colonised, immigration may contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates. Growth Models : Does the growth of a population with time show any specific and predictable pattern? We have been concerned about unbridled human population growth and problems created by it in our countIy and it is therefore natural for us to be curious if different animal populations in nature behave the same way or show some restraints on growth. Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from nature on how to control population growth. (1) Exponential growth: Resource (food and space) availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population. Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number, as Darwin observed while developing his theory of natural selection.

1066,207,"Duol Noture of Radiation ond Moﬁer SUMMARY The minimum energy needed by an electron to come out from a metal surface is called the work function of the metal. Energy [greater than the work function ((1)0) required for electron emission from the metal surface can be supplied by suitably heating or applying strong electric field or irradiating it by light of suitable frequency. Photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of emission of electrons by metals when illuminated by light of suitable frequency. Certain metals respond to ultraviolet light while others are sensitive even to the visible light. Photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical energy. It follows the law of conservation of energy. The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special features. Photoelectric current depends on (i) the intensity of incident light, (ii) the potential difference applied between the two electrodes, and [iii] the nature of the emitter material. The stopping potential We) depends on [i] the frequency of incident light, and (ii) the nature of the emitter material. For a given frequency of incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential is directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted: e V0 = [1/2] m vim = Kmax. Below a certain frequency [threshold frequency) v0, characteristic of the metal, no photoelectric emission takes place, no matter how large the intensity may be. The classical wave theory could not explain the main features of photoelectric effect. Its picture of continuous absorption of energy from radiation could not explain the independence of Kmax on intensity, the existence of v0 and the instantaneous nature of the process. Einstein explained these features on the basis of photon picture of light. According to this, light is composed of discrete packets of energy called quanta or photons. Each photon carries an energy E [= hv} and momentum p (= h/k), which depend on the frequency (v) of incident light and not on its intensity. Photoelectric emission from the metal surface occurs due to absorption of a photon by an electron. Einstein’s photoelectric equation is in accordance with the energy conservation law as applied to the photon absorption by an electron in the metal. The maximum kinetic energy (1/2)m vim is equal to the photon energy (hv) minus the work function (1)0 [= hvo] of the target metal: 1 Emvfmjx: V0 e= hv—¢0= h[v— v0) This photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric effect. Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s photoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s constant h. This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description [nature] of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment determines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for understanding the experimental result.

1067,1392,"BIOLOGY the other members of population (through sexual reproduction). Allelic (again recall the deﬁnition of alleles from Chapter 5) sequence variation has traditionally been described as a DNA polymorphism if more than one variant (allele) at a locus occurs in human population with a frequency greater than 0.0 1. In simple terms, if an inheritable mutation is observed in a population at high frequency, it is referred to as DNA polymorphism. The probability of such variation to be observed in non- coding DNA sequence would be higher as mutations in these sequences may not have any immediate effect / impact in an individual’s reproductive ability. These mutations keep on accumulating generation after generation, and form one of the basis of variability/ polymorphism. There is a variety of different types of polymorphisms ranging from single nucleotide change to very large scale changes. For evolution and speciation, such polymorphisms play very important role, and you will study these in details at higher classes. The technique of DNA Fingerprinting was initially developed by Alec J effreys. He used a satellite DNA as probe that shows very high degree of polymorphism. It was called as Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR). The technique, as used earlier, involved Southern blot hybridisation using radiolabelled VNTR as a probe. It included (i) isolation of DNA, (ii) digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases, (iii) separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis, (iv) transferring (blotting) of separated DNA fragments to synthetic membranes, such as nitrocellulose or nylon, (v) hybridisation using labelled VN’I‘R probe, and (vi) detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography. A schematic representation of DNA fingerprinting is shown in Figure 6. 1 6. The VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite. A small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The copy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual. The numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a result the size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to 20 kb. Consequently, after hybridisation with VNTR probe, the autoradiogram gives many bands of differing sizes. These bands give a characteristic pattern for an individual DNA (Figure 6.16). It differs from individual to individual in a population except in the case of monozygotic (identical) twins. The sensitivity of the technique has been increased by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR—you will study about it in Chapter 1 1). Consequently, DNA from a single cell is enough to perform DNA fingerprinting analysis. In addition to application in forensic 2019-2020",1

In the presence of an external magnetic field B, the force on these carriers is: F = (nlA)q vd x B where q is the value of the charge on a carrier. Now nq v01 is the current density j and | (nq vd) IA is the current I (see Chapter 3 for the discussion of current and current density). Thus, F = [(nqu)lA] x B = [jAl] x B = I l x B (4.4) where lis a vector of magnitude L the length of the rod, and with a direction identical to the current I . Note that the current I is not a vector. In the last step leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from j to 1. Equation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, B is the external magnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying rod. If the wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force on it by considering it as a collection of linear strips dlj and summing F = 21d:j x B i This summation can be converted to an integral in most cases. ON PERMITTIVITY AND PERMEABILITY In the universal law of gravitation, we say that any two point masses exert a force on each other which is proportional to the product of the masses m1, m2 and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between them. We write it as F= Gm1m2/ r2 where G is the universal constant of gravitation. Similarly, in Coulomb’s law of electrostatics we write the force between two point charges q1, q2, separated by a distance r as F = kq1q2/ r2 where k is a constant of proportionality. In SI units, k is taken as 1 /4TC8 where s is the permittivity of the medium. Also in magnetism, we get another constant, which in SI units, is taken as [.1/47t where ,u is the permeability of the medium. Although G, 8 and ,u arise as proportionality constants, there is a difference between gravitational force and electromagnetic force. While the gravitational force does not depend on the intervening medium, the electromagnetic force depends on the medium between the two charges or magnets. Hence, while G is a universal constant, 8 and ,u depend on the medium. They have different values for different media. The product 8/.1 turns out to be related to the speed 0 of electromagnetic radiation in the medium through 8/.1 = 1 / 02. Electric permittivity 8 is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects and is affected by a medium. It is determined by the ability of a material to polarise in response to an applied field, and thereby to cancel, partially, the ﬁeld inside the material. Similarly, magnetic permeability ,u is the ability of a substance to acquire magnetisation in magnetic fields. It is a measure of the extent to which magnetic field can penetrate matter.

The individual chromosomes can no longer be seen and each set of chromatin material tends to collect at each of the two poles (Figure 10.2 d). This is the stage which shows the following key events: 0 Chromosomes cluster at opposite spindle poles and their identity is lost as discrete elements. 0 Nuclear envelope develops around the chromosome clusters at each pole forming two daughter nuclei. 0 Nucleolus, golgi complex and ER reform. 10.2.5 Cytokinesis Mitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but the cell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separation of cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which cell division gets completed (Figure 10.2 e). In an animal cell, this is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma membrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately joins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plant cells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell wall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a different mechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre of the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateral walls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with the formation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate that represents the middle lamella between the walls of two adjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles like mitochondria and plastids get distributed between the two daughter cells. In some organisms karyokinesis is not followed by cytokinesis as a result of which multinucleate condition arises leading to the formation of syncytium (e. g., liquid endosperm in coconut).",1

1077,741,"WAV ES 379 If on the other hand, the boundary point is not rigid but completely free to move (such as in the case of a string tied to a freely moving ring on a rod), the reﬂected pulse has the same phase and amplitude (assuming no energy dissipation) as the incident pulse. The net maximum displacement at the boundary is then twice the amplitude of each pulse. An example of non- rigid boundary is the open end of an organ pipe. To summarise, a travelling wave or pulse suffers a phase change of 7c on reﬂection at a rigid boundary and no phase change on reﬂection at an open boundary. To put this mathematically, let the incident travelling wave be y2(x,t) = asin(kx—a)t) At a rigid boundary, the reﬂected wave is given by yr(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt + 7:). = — asin (kx—wt) (15.35) At an open boundary, the reﬂected wave is given by yr(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt + O). = asin (kx—wt) (15.36) Clearly, at the rigid boundary, y = y2 + yr 2 0 at all times. 15.6.1 Standing Waves and Normal Modes We considered above reﬂection at one boundary. But there are familiar situations (a string fixed at either end or an air column in a pipe with either end closed) in which reﬂection takes place at two or more boundaries. In a string, for example, a wave travelling in one direction will get reﬂected at one end, which in turn will travel and get reﬂected from the other end. This will go on until there is a steady wave pattern set up on the string. Such wave patterns are called standing waves or stationary waves. To see this mathematically, consider a wave travelling along the positive direction of x-axis and a reﬂected wave of the same amplitude and wavelength in the negative direction of x-axis. From Eqs. (15.2) and (15.4), with ¢= O, we get: y,(x, t) = asin (kx— wt) y2(x, t) = a sin (kx + cot) The resultant wave on the string is, according to the principle of superposition: y (x, t) = y1(x, t) + y2(x, t) = a [sin (kx— wt) + sin (kx + wt)] Using the familiar trignometric identity Sin (A+B) + Sin (A—B) = 2 sin A cosB we get, y (x, t) = 2a sin kxcos wt (15.37) Note the important difference in the wave pattern described by Eq. (15.37) from that described by Eq. (15.2) or Eq. (15.4). The terms kx and cut appear separately, not in the combination kx - cut. The amplitude of this wave is 2a sin kx. Thus, in this wave pattern, the amplitude varies from point-to-point, but each element of the string oscillates with the same angular frequency a) or time period. There is no phase difference between oscillations of different elements of the wave. The string as a whole vibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at different points. The wave pattern is neither moving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they are called standing or stationary waves. The amplitude is fixed at a given location but, as remarked earlier, it is different at different locations. The points at which the amplitude is zero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are nodes; the points at which the amplitude is the largest are called antinodes. Fig. 15.12 shows a stationary wave pattern resulting from superposition of two travelling waves in opposite directions. The most significant feature of stationary waves is that the boundary conditions constrain the possible wavelengths or frequencies of vibration of the system. The system cannot oscillate with any arbitrary frequency (contrast this with a harmonic travelling wave), but is characterised by a set of natural frequencies or normal modes of oscillation. Let us determine these normal modes for a stretched string fixed at both ends. First, from Eq. (15.37), the positions of nodes (where the amplitude is zero) are given by sin kx = O . which implies kx= mt; n=0, 1, 2, 3, Since, k = 27r//’L , we get m1 x=?;n=0, 1,2,3,... (15.38) Clearly, the distance between any two 2 successive nodes is _ In the same way, the 2. 2019-20",0
1078,575,"i Physics The formulation of Bohr model involves electrical force between positively charged nucleus and electron. It does not include the electrical forces between electrons which necessarily appear in multi-electron atoms. (ii) While the Bohr’s model correctly predicts the frequencies of the light emitted by hydrogenic atoms, the model is unable to explain the relative intensities of the frequencies in the spectrum. In emission spectrum of hydrogen, some of the visible frequencies have weak intensity, others strong. Why? Experimental observations depict that some transitions are more favoured than others. Bohr’s model is unable to account for the intensity variations. Bohr’s model presents an elegant picture of an atom and cannot be generalised to complex atoms. For complex atoms we have to use a new and radical theory based on Quantum Mechanics, which provides a more complete picture of the atomic structure. LASER LIGHT Imagine a crowded market place or a railway platform with people entering a gate and going towards all directions. Their footsteps are random and there is no phase correlation between them. On the other hand, think of a large number of soldiers in a regulated march. Their footsteps are very well correlated. See figure here. This is similar to the difference between light emitted by an ordinary source like a candle or a bulb and that emitted fﬁﬂwfg; by a laser. The acronym LASER stands for Light Ampliﬁcation (5 {V33 :5 ,r’ by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Since its development 2:: 5:: in 1960, it has entered into all areas of science and technology. f, ”1 ~13; It has found applications in physics, chemistry, biology, ‘“ ‘r “ medicine, surgery, engineering, etc. There are low power (a) Light from a bulb lasers, with a power of 0.5 mW, called pencil lasers, which serve as pointers. There are also lasers of different power, WWW ”ZZLW suitable for delicate surgery of eye or glands in the stomach. mm Wﬁ w» Finally, there are lasers which can cut or weld steel. (b) Laser light Light is emitted from a source in the form of packets of waves. Light coming out from an ordinary source contains a mixture of many wavelengths. There is also no phase relation between the various waves. Therefore, such light, even if it is passed through an aperture, spreads very fast and the beam size increases rapidly with distance. In the case of laser light, the wavelength of each packet is almost the same. Also the average length of the packet of waves is much larger. This means that there is better phase correlation over a longer duration of time. This results in reducing the divergence of a laser beam substantially. If there are N atoms in a source, each emitting light with intensity I, then the total intensity produced by an ordinary source is proportional to N1, whereas in a laser source, it is proportional to N21. Considering that N is very large, we see that the light from a laser can be much stronger than that from an ordinary source. When astronauts of the Apollo missions visited the moon, they placed a mirror on its surface, facing the earth. Then scientists on the earth sent a strong laser beam, which was reﬂected by the mirror on the moon and received back on the earth. The size of the reﬂected laser beam and the time taken for the round trip were measured. This allowed a very accurate determination of (a) the extremely small divergence of a laser beam and (b) the distance of the moon from the earth. ‘ 432 2019-20",0

1080,806,"(i) (ii) BIOLOGY Regulate: Some organisms are able to maintain homeostasis by physiological (sometimes behavioural also) means which ensures constant body temperature, constant osmotic concentration, etc. All birds and mammals, and a very few lower vertebrate and invertebrate species are indeed capable of such regulation (thermoregulation and osmoregulation). Evolutionary biologists believe that the ‘success’ of mammals is largely due to their ability to maintain a constant body temperature and thrive whether they live in Antarctica or in the Sahara desert. The mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate their body temperature are similar to the ones that we humans use. We maintain a constant body temperature of 37°C. In summer, when outside temperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat profusely. The resulting evaporative cooling, similar to what happens with a desert cooler in operation, brings down the body temperature. In winter when the temperature is much lower than 37 0C, we start to shiver, a kind of exercise which produces heat and raises the body temperature. Plants, on the other hand, do not have such mechanisms to maintain internal temperatures. Conform : An overwhelming majority (99 per cent) of animals and nearly all plants cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature changes with the ambient temperature. In aquatic animals, the osmotic concentration of the body ﬂuids change with that of the ambient air, water osmotic concentration. These animals and plants are simply conformers. Considering the beneﬁts of a constant internal environment to the organism, we must ask why these conformers had not evolved to become regulators. Recall the human analogy we used above; much as they like, how many people can really afford an air conditioner? Many simply ‘sweat it out’ and resign themselves to suboptimal performance in hot summer months. Thermoregulation is energetically expensive for many organisms. This is particularly true for small animals like shrews and humming birds. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside; then they have to expend much energy to generate body heat through metabolism. This is the main reason why very small animals are rarely found in polar regions. During the course of evolution, the costs and beneﬁts of maintaining a constant internal environment are taken into consideration. Some species have evolved the ability to regulate, but only over a limited range of environmental conditions, beyond which they simply conform. If the stressful external conditions are localised or remain only for a short duration, the organism has two other alternatives for survival. 2019-2020",1

1082,995,"PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT The growth rate shows an increase that may be arithmetic or geometrical (Figure 15.4). In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division, only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and matures. The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exempliﬁed by a root elongating at a constant rate. Look at Figure 15.5. On plotting the length of the organ against time, a linear curve is obtained. Mathematically, it is expressed as E=g+n Lt = length at time ‘t’ L0 = length at time ‘zero’ r = growth rate / elongation per unit time. Let us now see what happens in geometrical growth. In most systems, the initial growth is slow (lag phase), and it increases rapidly thereafter — at an exponential rate (log or exponential phase). Here, both the progeny cells following mitotic cell division retain the ability to divide and continue to do so. However, with limited nutrient supply, the growth slows down leading to a stationary phase. If we plot the parameter of growth against time, we get a typical sigmoid or S—curve (Figure 15.6). A sigmoid curve is a characteristic of living organism growing in a natural environment. It is typical for all cells, tissues and organs of a plant. Can you think of more similar examples? What kind of a curve can you expect in a tree showing seasonal activities? The exponential growth can be expressed as W1 = WO ert W1 = ﬁnal size (weight, height, number etc.) WO = initial size at the beginning of the period r = growth rate t = time of growth e = base of natural logarithms Here, r is the relative growth rate and is also the measure of the ability of the plant to produce new plant material, referred to as efficiency index.

It requires that an enterprise should prepare a cash ﬂow statement and should present it for each accounting period for which ﬁnancial statements are presented. This chapter discusses this technique and explains the method of preparing a cash ﬂow statement for an accounting period. 6.1 Objectives of Cash Flow Statement A Cash ﬂow statement shows inﬂow and outﬂow of cash and cash equivalents from various activities of a company during a speciﬁc period. The primary objective of cash ﬂow statement is to provide useful information about cash ﬂows (inﬂows and outﬂows) of an enterprise during a particular period under various heads, i.e., operating activities, investing activities and ﬁnancing activities. This information is useful in providing users of ﬁnancial statements with a basis to assess the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents and the needs of the enterprise to utilise those cash ﬂows. The economic decisions that are taken by users require an evaluation of the ability of an enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents and the timing and certainty of their generation. 6.2 Beneﬁts of Cash Flow Statement Cash ﬂow statement provides the following beneﬁts : o A cash ﬂow statement when used along with other ﬁnancial statements provides information that enables users to evaluate changes in net assets of an enterprise, its financial structure (including its liquidity and solvency) and its ability to affect the amounts and timings of cash ﬂows in order to adapt to changing circumstances and opportunities. 0 Cash ﬂow information is useful in assessing the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents and enables users to develop models to assess and compare the present value of the future cash ﬂows of different enterprises. o It also enhances the comparability of the reporting of operating performance by different enterprises because it eliminates the effects of using different accounting treatments for the same transactions and events. 0 It also helps in balancing its cash inﬂow and cash outﬂow, keeping in response to changing condition. It is also helpful in checking the accuracy of past assessments of future cash ﬂows and in examining the relationship between proﬁtability and net cash ﬂow and impact of changing prices.",3

About 97 per cent of O2 is transported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O2 is carried in a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO2 is transported by RBCs whereas 7 0 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate. About 7 per cent of CO2 is carried in a dissolved state through plasma. 1? .4. 1 Transport of Oxygen Haemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the RBCs. 02 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form oxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of four molecules of 02. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily related to partial pressure of 02. Partial pressure of C02, hydrogen ion concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere with this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against the p02. This curve is called the Oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 17 .5) and is highly useful in studying the effect of factors like pCO2, H“ concentration, etc., on binding of 02 with haemoglobin.

This binding is related to the partial pressure of 002. p02 is a major factor which could affect this binding.

When enzyme catalysed reactions are observed, the rate would be vastly higher than the same but uncatalysed reaction. For example Carbonic anhydrase CO2 + H20 H2CO3 carbon dioxide water carbonic acid In the absence of any enzyme this reaction is very slow, with about 200 molecules of H2CO3 being formed in an hour. However, by using the enzyme present within the cytoplasm called carbonic anhydrase, the reaction speeds dramatically with about 600,000 molecules being formed every second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by about 10 million times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed! There are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique chemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when each of the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or different enzymes, is called a metabolic pathway. For example, Glucose —> 2 Pyruvic acid C H O + 02—) 2C3H‘1 O3+2H20 6126 is actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid through ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you study respiration in Chapter 14 you will study these reactions. At this stage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two additional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In our skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed. Under normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast, during fermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol (alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible. 9.12.2 How do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of Chemical Conversions? To understand this we should study enzymes a little more. We have already understood the idea of an ‘active site’. The chemical or metabolic conversion refers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is called a ‘substrate’. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional structures including an ‘active site’, convert a substrate (8) into a product (P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as: S—>P It is now understood that the substrate ‘8’ has to bind the enzyme at its ‘active site’ within a given cleft or pocket.

Hydroponics has been successfully employed as a technique for the commercial production of vegetables such as tomato, seedless cucumber and lettuce.

Diagrammatic views of the hydroponic technique is given in Figures 12.1 and 12.2. 12.2 ESSENTIAL MINERAL ELEMENTS Most of the minerals present in soil can enter plants through roots.

Some plant species accumulate selenium, some others gold, while some plants growing near nuclear test sites take up radioactive strontium. There are techniques that are able to detect the minerals even at a very low concentration (10‘8 g/ mL). The question is, whether all the diverse mineral elements present in a plant, for example, gold and selenium as mentioned above, are really necessary for plants? How do we decide what is essential for plants and what is not? 12.2. 1 Criteria for Essentiality The criteria for essentiality of an element are given below: (a) The element must be absolutely necessary for supporting normal growth and reproduction.

Our vertebral column (Figure 20.7) is formed by 26 serially arranged units called vertebrae and is dorsally placed. It extends from the base of the skull and constitutes the main framework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a central hollow portion (neural canal) through which the spinal cord passes. First vertebra is the atlas and it articulates with the occipital condyles. The vertebral column is differentiated into cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral (1 -fused) and coccygeal (l-fused) regions starting from the skull. The number of cervical vertebrae are seven in almost all mammals including human beings. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord, supports the head and serves as the point of attachment for the ribs and musculature of the back. Sternum is a ﬂat bone on the ventral midline of thorax. There are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a thin ﬂat bone connected dorsally to the vertebral column and ventrally to the sternum. It has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal end and is hence called bicephalic. First seven pairs of ribs are called true ribs. Dorsally, they are attached to the thoracic vertebrae and ventrally connected to the sternum with the help of hyaline cartilage. The 8th, 9th and 10th pairs of ribs do not articulate directly with the sternum but join the seventh rib with the help of hyaline cartilage. These are called vertebrochondral (false) ribs. Last 2 pairs (1 1th and 12th) of ribs are not connected ventrally and are therefore, called ﬂoating ribs. Thoracic vertebrae, ribs and sternum together form the rib cage (Figure 20.8). The bones of the limbs alongwith their girdles constitute the appendicular skeleton. Each limb is made of 30 bones. The bones of the hand (fore limb) are humerus, radius and",1

But how to deal with the problem of determination of area of an irregular figure? The mathematical notion of integral is necessary in connection with such problems. Let us take a concrete example. Suppose a variable force f (x) acts on a particle in its motion along x - axis from x = a to x = b. The problem is to determine the work done (W) by the force on the particle during the motion. This problem is discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Figure 3.3 1 shows the variation of ﬁx) with x. If the force were constant, work would be simply the area F(b-a) as shown in Fig. 3.3l(i).

1092,455,"5 [\ oo v—l H' 3 S A 5 § 3 O (D (:1 i 270 James Clerk Maxwell (1831 - 1879) Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, was among the greatest physicists of the nineteenth century. He derived the thermal velocity distribution of molecules in a gas and was among the first to obtain reliable estimates of molecular parameters from measurable quantities like viscosity, etc. Maxwell’s greatest acheivement was the uniﬁcation of the? laWS of electricity and magnetism (discovered by Coulomb, Oersted, Ampere and Faraday) into a consistent set of equations now called Maxwell’s equations. From these he arrived at the most important conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. Interestingly, Maxwell did not agree with the idea (strongly suggested by the Faraday’s laws of electrolysis) that electricity was particulate in nature. the speed of light( 3 X 108 m/s), obtained from optical measurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work thus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and light. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use by Marconi and others led in due course to the revolution in communication that we are witnessing today. In this chapter, we first discuss the need for displacement current and its consequences. Then we present a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves. The broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves, stretching from y rays (wavelength ~10‘12 m) to long radio waves (wavelength ~ 106 m) is described. How the electromagnetic waves are sent and received for communication is discussed in Chapter 1 5. 8.2 DISPLACEMENT CURRENT We have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current produces a magnetic ﬁeld around it. Maxwell showed that for logical consistency, a changing electric ﬁeld must also produce a magnetic ﬁeld. This effect is of great importance because it explains the existence of radio waves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other forms of electromagnetic waves. To see how a changing electric ﬁeld gives rise to a magnetic field, let us consider the process of charging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital law given by (Chapter 4) §B~dl = #0 i (t) (8.1) to ﬁnd magnetic ﬁeld at a point outside the capacitor. Figure 8. 1 (a) shows a parallel plate capacitor C which is a part of circuit through which a time-dependent current i (t) ﬂows . Let us ﬁnd the magnetic field at a point such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate capacitor. For this, we consider a plane circular loop of radius rwhose plane is perpendicular to the direction of the current-carrying Wire, and which is centred symmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From symmetry, the magnetic ﬁeld is directed along the circumference of the circular loop and is the same in magnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the magnitude of the ﬁeld, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (27: r). So we have B (2117) = ,uoi (t) (8 .2) 2019-20",0

Active transport is carried out by specific membrane-proteins. Hence different proteins in the membrane play a major role in both active as well as passive transport. Pumps are proteins that use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane. These pumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high concentration (‘uphill’ transport). Transport rate reaches a maximum when all the protein transporters are being used or are saturated. Like enzymes the carrier protein is very specific in what it carries across the membrane. These proteins are sensitive to inhibitors that react with protein side chains. 1 1 . 1 .4 Comparison of Different Transport Processes Table l 1.1 gives a comparison of the different transport mechanisms. Proteins in the membrane are responsible for facilitated diffusion and active transport and hence show common characterstics of being highly selective; they are liable to saturate, respond to inhibitors and are under hormonal regulation. But diffusion whether facilitated or not — take place only along a gradient and do not use energy.

ADDITIONAL EXERCISES Suppose the loop in Exercise 64 is stationary but the current feeding the electromagnet that produces the magnetic field is gradually reduced so that the field decreases from its initial value of 0.3 T at the rate of 0.02 T S'l. If the cut is joined and the loop has a resistance of 1.6 S), how much power is dissipated by the loop as heat? What is the source of this power? A square loop of side 12 cm with its sides parallel to X and Y axes is moved with a velocity of 8 cm S'1 in the positive x—direction in an environment containing a magnetic field in the positive z-direction. The field is neither uniform in space nor constant in time. It has a gradient of 10 '3 T cm‘1 along the negative x—direction (that is it increases by 10'3 T cm'1 as one moves in the negative x—direction), and it is decreasing in time at the rate of 10‘3T s‘l. Determine the direction and magnitude of the induced current in the loop if its resistance is 4.50 m9. It is desired to measure the magnitude of ﬁeld between the poles of a powerful loud speaker magnet. A small ﬂat search coil of area 2 cm2 with 25 closely wound turns, is positioned normal to the field direction, and then quickly snatched out of the field region. Equivalently, one can give it a quick 90° turn to bring its plane parallel to the field direction). The total charge ﬂown in the coil (measured by a ballistic galvanometer connected to coil) is 7.5 mC. The combined resistance of the coil and the galvanometer is 0.50 9.

1099,936,"REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS Reproduction is defined as a biological process in which an organism gives rise to young ones (offspring) similar to itself. The offspring grow, mature and in turn produce new offspring. Thus, there is a cycle of birth, growth and death. Reproduction enables the continuity of the species, generation after generation. You will study later in Chapter 5 (Principles of Inheritance and Variation) how genetic variation is created and inherited during reproduction. There is a large diversity in the biological world and each organism has evolved its own mechanism to multiply and produce offspring. The organism’s habitat, its internal physiology and several other factors are collectively responsible for how it reproduces. Based on whether there is participation of one organism or two in the process of reproduction, it is of two types. When offspring is produced by a single parent with or without the involvement of gamete formation, the reproduction is asexual. When two parents (opposite sex) participate in the reproductive process and also involve fusion of male and female gametes, it is called sexual reproduction. 1 . 1 ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION In this method, a single individual (parent) is capable of producing offspring. As a result, the offspring that are produced are not only identical to one another but are also exact copies of their parent. Are these offspring likely to be genetically identical or different? The term clone is used to describe such morphologically and genetically similar individuals. Bud Parent cell (a) Figure 1.2 Cell division in unicellular organism: (a) Budding in yeast; (b) Binary fission in Amoeba Let us see how widespread asexual reproduction is, among different groups of organisms. Asexual reproduction is common among single-celled organisms, and in plants and animals with relatively simple organisations. In Protists and Monerans, the organism or the parent cell divides by mitosis into two to give rise to new individuals (Figure 1.2). Thus, in these organisms cell division is itself a mode of reproduction. 2019-2020",1

Yet, if the total external force acting on the system is zero, the centre of mass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves uniformly in a straight line like a free particle. The vector Eq. (7.1 8a) is equivalent to three scalar equations, Px=cl,Py=CZansz=c3 (7.18b) Here PX, Py and PZ are the components of the total linear momentum vector P along the x—, y— and z—axes respectively; Cl, 02 and 03 are constants.

(b) The same spliting of the heavy nucleus radium (Ra) with the centre of mass at rest. The two product particles ﬂy back to back. As an example, let us consider the radioactive decay of a moving unstable particle, like the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus disintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an alpha particle. The forces leading to the decay are internal to the system and the external forces on the system are negligible. So the total linear momentum of the system is the same before and after decay. The two particles produced in the decay, the radon nucleus and the alpha particle, move in different directions in such a way that their centre of mass moves along the same path along which the original decaying radium nucleus was moving [Fig. 7.13(a)]. If we observe the decay from the frame of reference in which the centre of mass is at rest, the motion of the particles involved in the decay looks particularly simple; the product particles 2019-20 Fig. 7.14 (a) Trajectories of two stars, 81 (dotted line) and 52 (solid line) forming a binary system with their centre of mass C in uniform motion. (b) The same binary system, with the centre of mass C at rest. move back to back with their centre of mass remaining at rest as shown in Fig.7.13 (b). In many problems on the system of particles, as in the above radioactive decay problem, it is convenient to work in the centre of mass frame rather than in the laboratory frame of reference. In astronomy, binary (double) stars is a common occurrence. If there are no external forces, the centre of mass of a double star moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.7 . 14 (a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal mass are also shown in the figure; they look complicated. If we go to the centre of mass frame, then we find that there the two stars are moving in a circle, about the centre of mass, which is at rest. Note that the position of the stars have to be diametrically opposite to each other [Fig. 7 . 14(b)]. Thus in our frame of reference, the trajectories of the stars are a combination of (i) uniform motion in a straight line of the centre of mass and (ii) circular orbits of the stars about the centre of mass. As can be seen from the two examples, separating the motion of different parts of a system into motion of the centre of mass and motion about the centre of mass is a very useful technique that helps in understanding the motion of the system. 7.5 VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS We are already familiar with vectors and their use in physics.

This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems and roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers inside and beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cells in the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most cells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. This is also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems and roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces. The complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO2 and H20 as end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat. Gngg +. 1632: _—:‘>i meg lilaﬂér+JEnef ‘ If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to synthesise other molecules that the cell requires. The strategy that the plant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that not all the liberated energy goes out as heat. The key is to oxidise glucose not in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just large enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP synthesis. How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration. During the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon dioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion reaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may not be available. Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where 02 is not available? There are sufﬁcient reasons to believe that the ﬁrst cells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen. Even among present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted to anaerobic conditions. Some of these organisms are facultative anaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is obligate. In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery to partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen. This breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis. 14.2 GLYCOLYSIS The term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, glycos for sugar, and lysis for splitting. The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the EMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living organisms. In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from sucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage",1

Answer The range of variation over the seven days of observations is 162 s for clock 1, and 3 1 s for clock 2. The average reading of clock 1 is much closer to the standard time than the average reading of clock 2. The important point is that a clock’s zero error is not as significant for precision work as its variation, because a ‘zero-error’ can always be easily corrected. Hence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1. 4 Example 2.7 We measure the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum. In successive measurements. the readings turn out to be 2.63 s. 2.56 s. 2.42 s. 2.71s and 2.80 5. Calculate the absolute errors. relative error or percentage error. Answer The mean period of oscillation of the pendulum (2.63 + 256+ 2.42 + 2.71 + 2.80)s 5 13. 12 _ s ‘ 5 = 2.624 s = 2.62 s As the periods are measured to a resolution of 0.01 s, all times are to the second decimal; it is proper to put this mean period also to the second decimal. The errors in the measurements are 2.63s—2.62s= 0.01 s 2.56 s — 2.62 s = — 0.06 s 2.42 s — 2.62 s = — 0.20 s 2.71 s—2.62s= 0.09s 2.80s—2.62s= 0.18s Note that the errors have the same units as the quantity to be measured. The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors (for arithmetic mean, we take only the magnitudes) is ATmem = [(0.01+ 0.06+0.20+0.09+0.18)s]/5 = 0.54 s/5 = 0.1 1 s That means, the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum is (2.62 i 0.11) s i.e. it lies between (2.62 + 0.11) s and (2.62 — 0.11) s or between 2.73 s and 2.51 s. As the arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is 0.1 1 s, there is already an error in the tenth of a second. Hence there is no point in giving the period to a hundredth. A more correct way will be to write T=2.6i0.1 S Note that the last numeral 6 is unreliable, since it may be anything between 5 and 7.

1103,1183,"PLANT KINGDOM nuclei eventually fuse to produce a diploid secondary nucleus. Pollen grain, after dispersal from the anthers, are carried by wind or various other agencies to the stigma of a pistil. This is termed as pollination. The pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the resulting pollen tubes grow through the tissues of stigma and style and reach the ovule. The pollen tubes enter the embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One of the male gametes fuses with the egg cell (syngamy) to form a zygote. The other male gamete fuses with the diploid secondary nucleus to produce the triploid primary endosperm nucleus PEN). Because of the occurrence of two fusions i.e., syngamy and triple fusion, this event is termed as double fertilisation, an event unique to angiosperms. The zygote develops into an embryo (with one or two cotyledons) and the PEN develops into endosperm which provides nourishment to the developing embryo. The synergids and antipodals degenerate after fertilisation. During these events the ovules develop into seeds and the ovaries develop into fruit.

CO H 3 E If] Example 13.7 Answer the following questions: (a) (b) (C) Are the equations of nuclear reactions (such as those given in Section 13.7) ‘balanced’ in the sense a chemical equation (e.g., 2H2 + 02—) 2 H20) is? If not, in what sense are they balanced on both sides? If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are conserved in each nuclear reaction, in what way is mass converted into energy (or vice-versa) in a nuclear reaction? A general impression exists that mass-energy interconversion takes place only in nuclear reaction and never in chemical reaction. This is strictly speaking, incorrect. Explain. Solution (a) (b) (C) A chemical equation is balanced in the sense that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. A chemical reaction merely alters the original combinations of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus, the number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved in a nuclear reaction. However, the number of protons and the number of neutrons are both separately conserved in a nuclear reaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of very high energies — what is strictly conserved is the total charge and total ‘baryon number’. We need not pursue this matter here.) In nuclear reactions (e. g., Eq. 13.26), the number of protons and the number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation. We know that the binding energy of a nucleus gives a negative contribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since proton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear reaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same on either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei on the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand side. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy released or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy contributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass of nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa. It is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of mass- energy interconversion. From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical reaction is similar to a nuclear reaction in principle. The energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the difference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms and molecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly speaking, chemical binding energy also gives a negative contribution (mass defect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule, we can equally well say that the difference in the total mass of atoms or molecules, on the two sides of the chemical reaction gets converted into energr or vice-versa. However, the mass defects involved in a chemical reaction are almost a million times smaller than those in a nuclear reaction.This is the reason for the general impression, (which is incorrect) that mass-energy interconversion does not take place in a chemical reaction. 2019-20",0

The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA. Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net force or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F1 and F2. They too are equal and opposite, with magnitude, F1 = F2 = I b B But they are not collinear! This results in a couple as before. The torque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was along the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distance between the forces of the couple has decreased.

Estimate the average pressure sustained by the femurs. Answer Total cross-sectional area of the femurs is A = 2 x 10 em2 = 20 x 10'4 m2. The force acting on them is F = 40 kg wt = 400 N (taking 9 = 10 m S'2). This force is acting vertically down and hence, normally on the femurs. Thus, the average pressure is Pau=%=2><105Nm_2 4 10.2. 1 Pascal's Law The French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that the pressure in a ﬂuid at rest is the same at all points if they are at the same height. This fact may be demonstrated in a simple way. Fig. 10.2 Proof of Pascal’s law. ABC—DEF is an element of the interior of a ﬂuid at rest. This element is in the form of a right— angled prism The element is small so that the effect of gravity can be ignored, but it has been enlarged for the sake of clarity. Fig. 10.2 shows an element in the interior of a ﬂuid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the form of a right-angled prism. In principle, this prismatic element is very small so that every part of it can be considered at the same depth from the liquid surface and therefore, the effect of the gravity is the same at all these points. But for clarity we have enlarged this element. The forces on this element are those exerted by the rest of the ﬂuid and they must be normal to the surfaces of the element as discussed above. Thus, the ﬂuid exerts pressures Pa, Pb and PC on 2019-20 this element of area corresponding to the normal forces Fa, Fb and Fe as shown in Fig. 10.2 on the faces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by Aa, Ab and AC respectively. Then Fb sine = F0, Fb cosB = Fa (by equilibrium) Ab sine = AC, Ab cost) = A3 (by geometry) Thus, F b _ F c _ Fa . Ab AC Aa ’ Hence, pressure exerted is same in all directions in a ﬂuid at rest. It again reminds us that like other types of stress, pressure is not a vector quantity. No direction can be assigned to it. The force against any area within (or bounding) a ﬂuid at rest and under pressure is normal to the area, regardless of the orientation of the area. Now consider a ﬂuid element in the form of a horizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar is in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted at its two ends must be balanced or the pressure at the two ends should be equal. This proves that for a liquid in equilibrium the pressure is same at all points in a horizontal plane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in different parts of the ﬂuid, then there would be a ﬂow as the ﬂuid will have some net force acting on it. Hence in the absence of ﬂow the pressure in the ﬂuid must be same everywhere in a horizontal plane. Pb = Pa = Pa (10.4) 10.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth Consider a ﬂuid at rest in a container. In Fig. 10.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2. The pressures at points 1 and 2 are P1 and P2 respectively. Consider a cylindrical element of ﬂuid having area of base A and height h. As the ﬂuid is at rest the resultant horizontal forces should be zero and the resultant vertical forces should balance the weight of the element. The forces acting in the vertical direction are due to the ﬂuid pressure at the top (PIA) acting downward, at the bottom (P2A) acting upward. If mg is weight of the ﬂuid in the cylinder we have (P2—P1) A = mg (10.5) Now, if p is the mass density of the ﬂuid, we have the mass of ﬂuid to be m = pV= phA so that P2 —P1= pgh (10.6)",0

A 3 MW tidal power project at Durgaduani in Sunderbans of West Bengal is under way. OCEAN CURRENTS Ocean currents are like river ﬂow in oceans. They represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction. Ocean currents are inﬂuenced by two types of forces namely : (i) primary forces that initiate the movement of water; (ii) secondary forces that inﬂuence the currents to ﬂow. The primary forces that inﬂuence the currents are: (i) heating by solar energy; (ii) wind; (iii) gravity; (iv) coriolis force. Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That is why, near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to ﬂow down the slope. Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move. Friction between the wind and the water surface affects the movement of the water body in its course. Gravity tends to pull the water down the pile and create gradient variation. The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. These large accumulations of water and the ﬂow around them are called Gyres. These produce large circular currents in all the ocean basins. Characteristics of Ocean Currents Currents are referred to by their “drift”. Usually, the currents are strongest near the surface and may attain speeds over five knots. At depths, currents are generally slow with speeds less than 0.5 knots. We refer to the speed of a current as its “drift.” Drift is measured in terms of knots. The strength of a current refers to the speed of the current. A fast current is considered strong. A current is usually strongest at the surface and decreases in strength (speed) with depth. Most currents have speeds less than or equal to 5 knots. 119 Differences in water density affect vertical mobility of ocean currents. Water with high salinity is denser than water with low salinity and in the same way cold water is denser than warm water. Denser water tends to sink, while relatively lighter water tends to rise. Cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at the poles sinks and slowly moves towards the equator. Warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the surface, ﬂowing towards the poles to replace the sinking cold water. Types of Ocean Currents The ocean currents may be classified based on their depth as surface currents and deep water currents : (i) surface currents constitute about 10 per cent of all the water in the ocean, these waters are the upper 400 m of the ocean; (ii) deep water currents make up the other 90 per cent of the ocean water. These waters move around the ocean basins due to variations in the density and gravity. Deep waters sink into the deep ocean basins at high latitudes, where the temperatures are cold enough to cause the density to increase. Ocean currents can also be classified based on temperature : as cold currents and warm currents: (i) cold currents bring cold water into warm water areas. These currents are usually found on the west coast of the continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres) and on the east coast in the higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere; (ii) warm currents bring warm water into cold water areas and are usually observed on the east coast of continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres). In the northern hemisphere they are found on the west coasts of continents in high latitudes. Major Ocean Currents Maj or ocean currents are greatly inﬂuenced by the stresses exerted by the prevailing winds and coriolis force. The oceanic circulation pattern roughly corresponds to the earth’s atmospheric circulation pattern. The air circulation over the oceans in the middle latitudes is mainly anticyclonic (more pronounced in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere). The oceanic circulation pattern also corresponds with the same. At higher latitudes, 2019-2020",2

Fig. 6.7 shows a block attached to a spring and resting on a smooth horizontal surface. The other end of the spring is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light and may be treated as massless.

(15.12) then relates wavelength to frequency for the given speed. Of course, as remarked earlier, the medium can support both transverse and longitudinal waves, which will have different speeds in the same medium. Later in this chapter, we shall obtain specific expressions for the speed of mechanical waves in some media. 15.4.1 Speed of a Transverse Wave on Stretched String The speed of a mechanical wave is determined by the restoring force setup in the medium when it is disturbed and the inertial properties (mass density) of the medium. The speed is expected to be directly related to the former and inversely to the latter. For waves on a string, the restoring force is provided by the tension Tin the string. The inertial property will in this case be linear mass density p, which is mass m of the string divided by its length L. Using Newton’s Laws of Motion, an exact formula for the wave speed on a string can be derived, but this derivation is outside the scope of this book. We shall, therefore, use dimensional analysis. We already know that dimensional analysis alone can never yield the exact formula. The overall dimensionless constant is always left undetermined by dimensional analysis. The dimension of ,u is [ML—1] and that of T is like force, namely [MLT2]. We need to combine these dimensions to get the dimension of speed v [L’ILI]. Simple inspection shows that the quantity T/u has the relevant dimension [MLT—Z] [MEI] Thus if T and u are assumed to be the only relevant physical quantities, =[L2T-2] v =C E (15.13) y where C is the undetermined constant of dimensional analysis. In the exact formula, it turms out, C=l. The speed of transverse waves on a stretched string is given by v = 3 (15.14) )1 Note the important point that the speed v depends only on the properties of the medium T and ,u (T is a property of the stretched string arising due to an external force). It does not depend on wavelength or frequency of the wave itself. In higher studies, you will come across waves whose speed is not independent of frequency of the wave. Of the two parameters 2L and v the source of disturbance determines the frequency of the wave generated. Given the Propagation of a pulse on a rope You can easily see the motion of a pulse on a rope. You can also see its reﬂection from a rigid boundary and measure its velocity of travel. You will need a rope of diameter 1 to 3 cm, two hooks and some weights. You can perform this experiment in your classroom or laboratory. Take a long rope or thick string of diameter 1 to 3 cm. and tie it to hooks on opposite walls in a hall or laboratory. Let one end pass on a hook and hang some weight [about 1 to 5 kg) to it. The walls may be about 3 to 5 m apart. Take a stick or a rod and strike the rope hard at a point near one end. This creates a pulse on the rope which now travels on it. You can see it reaching the end and reﬂecting back from it. You can check the phase relation between the incident pulse and reﬂected pulse. You can easily watch two or three reﬂections before the pulse dies out. You can take a stopwatch and find the time for the pulse to travel the distance between the walls. and thus measure its velocity. Compare it with that obtained from Eq. [15.14]. This is also what happens with a thin metallic string of a musical instrument. The major difference is that the velocity on a string is fairly high because of low mass per unit length. as compared to that on a thick rope. The low velocity on a rope allows us to watch the motion and make measurements beautifully. 2019-20",0

The idea is to get an erect, magniﬁed and virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed comfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more. If the object is at a distance f, the image is at infinity. However, if the object is at a distance slightly less than the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than inﬁnity. Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image is when it is at the near point (distance DE 25 cm), it causes some strain on the eye. Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered most suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye. We show both cases, the ﬁrst in Fig. 9.27 (a), and the second in Fig. 9.27[b) and (c). The linear magniﬁcation m, for the image formed at the near point D, by a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation ”Eat-ﬂit?)

1119,137,"Nuclei — INDIA’S ATONHC ENERGY PROGRAMME The atomic energy programme in India was launched around the time of independence under the leadership of Homi J. Bhabha (1909- 1966). An early historic achievement was the design and construction of the ﬁrst nuclear reactor in India (named Apsara) which went critical on August 4, 1956. It used enriched uranium as fuel and water as moderator. Following this was another notable landmark: the construction of CIRUS (Canada India Research U.S.) reactor in 1960. This 40 MW reactor used natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as moderator. Apsara and CIRUS spurred research in a wide range of areas of basic and applied nuclear science. An important milestone in the ﬁrst two decades of the programme was the indigenous design and construction of the plutonium plant at Trombay, which ushered in the technology of fuel reprocessing (separating useful ﬁssile and fertile nuclear materials from the spent fuel of a reactor) in India. Research reactors that have been subsequently commissioned include ZERLINA, PURNIMA (I, II and III), DHRUVA and KAMINI. KAMINI is the country’s ﬁrst large research reactor that uses U—233 as fuel. As the name suggests, the primary objective of a research reactor is not generation of power but to provide a facility for research on different aspects of nuclear science and technology. Research reactors are also an excellent source for production of a variety of radioactive isotopes that ﬁnd application in diverse fields: industry, medicine and agriculture. The main objectives of the Indian Atomic Energy programme are to provide safe and reliable electric power for the country’s social and economic progress and to be self- reliant in all aspects of nuclear technology. Exploration of atomic minerals in India undertaken since the early ﬁfties has indicated that India has limited reserves of uranium, but fairly abundant reserves of thorium. Accordingly, our country has adopted a three- stage strategy of nuclear power generation. The ﬁrst stage involves the use of natural uranium as a fuel, with heavy water as moderator. The Plutonium-239 obtained from reprocessing of the discharged fuel from the reactors then serves as a fuel for the second stage — the fast breeder reactors. They are so called because they use fast neutrons for sustaining the chain reaction (hence no moderator is needed) and, besides generating power, also breed more ﬁssile species (plutonium) than they consume. The third stage, most signiﬁcant in the long term, involves using fast breeder reactors to produce ﬁssile Uranium-233 from Thorium-232 and to build power reactors based on them. India is currently well into the second stage of the programme and considerable work has also been done on the third — the thorium utilisation — stage. The country has mastered the complex technologies of mineral exploration and mining, fuel fabrication, heavy water production, reactor design, construction and operation, fuel reprocessing, etc. Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) built at different sites in the country mark the accomplishment of the first stage of the programme. India is now more than self-sufﬁcient in heavy water production. Elaborate safety measures both in the design and operation of reactors, as also adhering to stringent standards of radiological protection are the hallmark of the Indian Atomic Energy Programme. produced, in some 3, etc. The extra neutrons in turn can initiate ﬁssion processes, producing still more neutrons, and so on. This leads to the possibility of a chain reaction, as was ﬁrst suggested by Enrico Fermi. If the chain reaction is controlled suitably, we can get a steady energy 453 2019-20",0

It is characterised by memory. This means when our body encounters a pathogen for the ﬁrst time it produces a response called primary response which is of low intensity. Subsequent encounter with the same pathogen elicits a highly intensiﬁed secondary or anamnestic response. This is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the ﬁrst encounter. The primary and secondary / immune responses are Antigen binding site carried out with the help of two special types of lymphocytes present in our blood, i.e., B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes. ’Ihe B—lymphocytes produce an army of proteins in response to pathogens into our blood to ﬁght with them. These proteins are called antibodies. The T-cells themselves do not secrete antibodies but help B cells to produce them. Each antibody molecule has four peptide chains, two small called light chains and Heavy chain Antigen binding site two longer called heavy chains. Figure 8.4 Structure of an antibody molecule Hence, an antibody is represented as H2L2. Different types of antibodies are produced in our body. IgA, IgM, IgE, IgG are some of them.

When light rays undergoes two internal reﬂections inside a raindrop, instead of one as in the primary rainbow, a secondary rainbow is formed as shown in Fig. 925(0). It is due to four-step process. The intensity of light is reduced at the second reﬂection and hence the secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary rainbow. Further, the order of the colours is reversed in it as is clear from Fig. 925(0). 9.7.2 Scattering of light As sunlight travels through the earth’s atmosphere, it gets scattered (changes its direction) by the atmospheric particles. Light of shorter wavelengths is scattered much more than light of longer wavelengths. (The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This is known as Rayleigh scattering). Hence, the bluish colour predominates in a clear sky, since blue has a shorter wave- length than red and is scattered much more strongly. In fact, violet gets scattered even more than blue, having a shorter wavelength. But since our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, we see the sky blue. Large particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere behave differently. The relevant quantity here is the relative size of the wavelength of light 2., and the scatterer (of typical size, say, a). For a << 1, one has Rayleigh scattering which is proportional to 1/14. For a >> A, i.e., large scattering objects (for example, raindrops, large dust or ice particles) this is not true; all wavelengths are scattered nearly equally. Thus, clouds which have droplets of water with a >> A are generally white. 2019-20",0

That is, its position uncertainty is inﬁnite (Ax a co), which is consistent with the uncertainty principle. In general, the matter wave associated with the electron is not extended all over space. It is a wave packet extending over some ﬁnite region of space. In that case Axis not inﬁnite but has some ﬁnite value depending on the extension of the wave packet. Also, you must appreciate that a wave packet of ﬁnite extension does not have a single wavelength. It is built up of wavelengths spread around some central wavelength. By de Broglie’s relation, then, the momentum of the electron will also have a spread — an uncertainty Ap. This is as expected from the uncertainty principle. It can be shown that the wave packet description together with de Broglie relation and Born’s probability interpretation reproduce the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle exactly. In Chapter 12, the de Broglie relation will be seen to justify Bohr’s postulate on quantisation of angular momentum of electron in an atom.

1125,628,"Duol Nature of Radiation and Moﬁer particles. They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1 to 0.2 times the speed of light (3 X 108 m / s). The presently accepted value of e/m is 1.76 X 1011 C/kg. Further, the value of e/m was found to be independent of the nature of the material/ metal used as the cathode (emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation suggested the universality of the cathode ray particles. Around the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when irradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having small speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were found to emit negatively charged particles. The value of e/ mof these particles was found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These observations thus established that all these particles, although produced under different conditions, were identical in nature. J. J. Thomson, in 1 897, named these particles as electrons, and suggested that they were fundamental, universal constituents of matter. For his epoch-making discovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental investigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. In 1913, the American physicist R. A. Millikan (1868-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for the precise measurement of the charge on an electron. He found that the charge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary charge, 1.602 X 10‘19 C. Millikan’s experiment established that electric charge is quantised From the values of charge (e) and speciﬁc charge (e/ m), the mass (m) of the electron could be determined. 1 1.2 ELECTRON EMISSION We know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that are responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot normally escape out of the metal surface. If an electron attempts to come out of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge and pulls the electron back to the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal surface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can come out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome the attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be given to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This minimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface is called the work junction of the metal. It is generally denoted by $0 and measured in eV (electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an electron when it has been accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt, so that 1 eV= 1.602 X10‘19J. This unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics. The work function ($0) depends on the properties of the metal and the nature of its surface. The values of work function of some metals are given in Table 1 1.1. These values are approximate as they are very sensitive to surface impurities. Note from Table 1 1. 1 that the work function of platinum is the highest (¢0= 5.65 eV) while it is the lowest ($0 = 2.14 eV) for caesium. The minimum energy required for the electron emission from the metal surface can be supplied to the free electrons by any one of the following physical processes: 2019-20 387",0

It allows to find the moment of inertia of a body about any axis, given the moment of inertia of the body about a parallel axis through the centre of mass of the body. We shall only state this theorem and not give its proof. We shall, however, apply it to a few simple situations which will be enough to convince us about the usefulness of the theorem. The theorem may be stated as follows: The moment of inertia of a body about any axis is equal to the sum of the moment of inertia of the body about a parallel axis passing through its centre of mass and the product of its mass and the square of the distance between the two parallel axes. As shown in the Fig. 7.31, z and z’ are two parallel axes, separated by a distance a. The z-axis passes through the centre of mass 0 of the rigid body.

For example, the angular velocity 0) plays the same role in rotation as the linear velocity v in translation. We wish to take this analogy further. In doing so we shall restrict the discussion only to rotation about fixed axis. This case of motion involves only one degree of freedom, i.e., needs only one independent variable to describe the motion. This in translation corresponds to linear motion. This section is limited only to kinematics. We shall turn to dynamics in later sections. We recall that for specifying the angular displacement of the rotating body we take any particle like P (Fig.7 .33) of the body. Its angular displacement 6 in the plane it moves is the angular displacement of the whole body; 0 is measured from a fixed direction in the plane of motion of P, which we take to be the x’-axis, chosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown, the axis of rotation is the z — axis and the plane of the motion of the particle is the x - y plane. Fig. 7.33 also shows 00, the angular displacement at t= 0.

After maturation the lymphocytes migrate to secondary lymphoid organs like spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patches of small intestine and appendix.

The location of various lymphoid organs in the human body is shown in Figure 8.5. The bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all blood cells including lymphocytes are produced. The thymus is a lobed organ located near the heart and beneath the breastbone. The thymus is quite large at the time of birth but keeps reducing in size with age and by the time puberty is attained it reduces to a very small size. Both bone-marrow and thymus provide micro-environments for the development and maturation of T-lymphocytes. The spleen is a large bean- shaped organ. It mainly contains lymphocytes and phagocytes. It acts as a ﬁlter of the blood by trapping blood-borne micro- organisms. Spleen also has a large reservoir of erythrocytes. The lymph nodes are small solid structures located at different points along the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes serve to trap the micro-organisms or other antigens, which happen to get into the lymph and tissue ﬂuid. Antigens trapped in the lymph nodes are responsible for the activation of lymphocytes present there and cause the immune response. There is lymphoid tissue also located within the lining of the major tracts (respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts) called mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

An inﬁnitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar and the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the surface. Just as for reﬂection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the point of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical surface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of curvature. We ﬁrst consider refraction by a single spherical surface and follow it by thin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical. Applying the formula for image formation by a single spherical surface successively at the two surfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker’s formula and then the lens formula. 9.5. 1 Refraction at a spherical surface Figure 9.1 7 shows the geometry of formation of image I of an object O on the principal axis of a spherical surface with centre of curvature C, and radius of curvature R. The rays are incident from a medium of refractive index n1, to another of refractive index n2. As before, we take the aperture (or the lateral size) of the surface to be small compared to other distances involved, so that small angle approximation can be made. In particular, NM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of the perpendicular from the point N on the principal axis.

He is also credited with the invention of the electric motor, the electric generator and the transformer. He is widely regarded as the greatest experimental scientist of the nineteenth century. The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic ﬂux through the circuit. Mathematically, the induced emf is given by _dqu 8: dt (6.3) The negative sign indicates the direction of 8 and hence the direction of current in a closed loop. This will be discussed in detail in the next section. In the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change of ﬂux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore, the expression for the total induced emf is given by dqu dt The induced emf can be increased by increasing the number of turns N of a closed coil. From Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the ﬂux can be varied by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and 6. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the ﬂux is changed by varying B. The ﬂux can also be altered by changing the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or stretching it) in a magnetic ﬁeld, or rotating a coil in a magnetic field such that the angle 0 between B and A changes. In these cases too, an emf is induced in the respective coils. 8=—N (6.4) Example 6. 1 Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtain a large deﬂection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstrate the presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer? Solution (a) To obtain a large deﬂection, one or more of the following steps can be taken: (i) Use a rod made of soft iron inside the coil C2, (ii) Connect the coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) Move the arrangement rapidly towards the test coil Cl. (b) Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one ﬁnds in a EXAMPLE 6. 1 small torch light. The relative motion between the two coils will cause the bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an induced current. In experimental physics one must leam to innovate. Michael Faraday who is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever; was legendary for his innovative skills.

1132,1405,"HOBZCHIO CHAPTER 1@ arlier Chapter 9 described the uneven E distribution of temperature over the surface of the earth. Air expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled. This results in variations in the atmospheric pressure. The result is that it causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure, setting the air in motion. You already know that air in horizontal motion is wind. Atmospheric pressure also determines when the air will rise or sink. The wind redistributes the heat and moisture across the planet, thereby, maintaining a constant temperature for the planet as a whole. The vertical rising of moist air cools it down to form the clouds and bring precipitation. This chapter has been devoted to explain the causes of pressure differences, the forces that control the atmospheric circulation, the turbulent pattern of wind, the formation of air masses, the disturbed weather when air masses interact with each other and the phenomenon of violent tropical storms. ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE Do you realise that our body is subjected to a lot of air pressure. As one moves up the air gets varified and one feels breathless. The weight of a column of air contained in a unit area from the mean sea level to the top of the atmosphere is called the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is expressed in units of milibar. At sea level the average atmospheric pressure is 1,0 13.2 milibar. Due to gravity the air at the surface is denser and hence has higher pressure. Air ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND WEATHER SYSTEMS pressure is measured with the help of a mercury barometer or the aneroid barometer. Consult your book, Practical Work in Geography — Part I (NCERT, 2006) and learn about these instruments. The pressure decreases with height. At any elevation it varies from place to place and its variation is the primary cause of air motion, i.e. wind which moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas. Vertical Variation of Pressure In the lower atmosphere the pressure decreases rapidly with height. The decrease amounts to about 1 mb for each 10 m increase in elevation. It does not always decrease at the same rate. Table 10.1 gives the average pressure and temperature at selected levels of elevation for a standard atmosphere.

This implies that greater the frequency of incident light, greater is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. Consequently, we need greater retarding potential to stop them completely. If we plot a graph between the frequency of incident radiation and the corresponding stopping potential for different metals we get a straight line, as shown in Fig. 1 1.5.

(ii) there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency v0 for which the stopping potential is zero. These observations have two implications: (i) The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly with the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity. (ii) For a frequency v of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off frequency v0, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the intensity is large. This minimum, cut-off frequency v0, is called the threshold frequency. It is different for different metals. Different photosensitive materials respond diiferently to light. Selenium is more sensitive than zinc or copper. The same photosensitive substance gives different response to light of different wavelengths. For example, ultraviolet light gives rise to photoelectric effect in copper while green or red light does not. Note that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of the incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric emission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if the incident radiation is very dim. It is now known that emission starts in a time of the order of 10‘9 s or less. We now summarise the experimental features and observations described in this section. (i) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation (above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig. 1 1.2). (ii) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation, saturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of incident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of its intensity (Fig. 1 1.3). (iii) For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the threshold frequency, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place, no matter how intense the incident light is.

Metallic bodies of the electric appliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the earth wire. When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body, the charge ﬂows to the earth without damaging the appliance and without causing any injury to the humans; this would have otherwise been unavoidable since the human body is a conductor of electricity. 1.4 CHARGING BY INDUCTION When we touch a pith ball with an electriﬁed plastic rod, some of the negative charges on the rod are transferred to the pith ball and it also gets charged. Thus the pith ball is charged by contact. It is then repelled by the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely charged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is a question we have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be happening by performing the following experiment. (i) Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands, in contact as shown in Fig. 1.4(a). (ii) Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking care that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres are attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge on the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in the metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an excess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an excess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres have accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge starts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled by these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of force of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the accumulated charges. Fig. 1.4(b) shows the equilibrium situation. The process is called induction of charge and happens almost instantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown, till the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the charges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to their original neutral state. (iii) Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still held near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c). The two spheres are found to be oppositely charged and attract each other. (iv) Remove the rod. The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as shown in Fig. 1.4(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The charges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in Fig. 1.4(e). In this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely charged. This is charging by induction. The positively charged glass rod does not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by contact. When electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect takes place. The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of the objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object. 2019-20",0

Towards the same period at the end of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity (electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led to many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895, and of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in the understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufﬁciently low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took place between the two electrodes on applying the electric ﬁeld to the gas in the discharge tube. A ﬂuorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite to cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass, it being yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this ﬂuorescence was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the cathode. These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams of fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist J. J. Thomson (1856- 1940) conﬁrmed this hypothesis. By applying mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds across the discharge tube, J. J. Thomson was the ﬁrst to determine experimentally the speed and the speciﬁc charge [charge to mass ratio (e/ m)] of the cathode ray 2019-20",0
1137,863,"BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES sternum causing an increase in the volume of the thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis. The overall increase in the thoracic volume causes a similar increase in pulmonary volume. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intra—pulmonary pressure to less than the atmospheric pressure which forces the air from outside to move into the lungs, i.e., inspiration (Figure 17 .2a). Relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary volume. This leads to an increase in intra—pulmonary pressure to slightly above the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of air from the lungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 1 7 .2b). We have the ability to increase the strength of inspiration and expiration with the help of additional muscles in the abdomen. On an average, a healthy human breathes 12-16 times/ minute. The volume of air involved in breathing movements can be estimated by using a spirometer which helps in clinical assessment of pulmonary functions. 17.2. 1 Respiratory Volumes and Capacities Tidal Volume (TV): Volume of air inspired or expired during a normal respiration.

1140,1386,"HUMAN REPRODUCTION A functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals. The mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat. The glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 1 5-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells called alveoli (Figure 3.4). The cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored in the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules. The tubules of each lobe join to form a mammary duct. Several mammary ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla which is connected to lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out. 3.3 GAMETOGENESIS The primary sex organs — the testis in the males and the ovaries in the females—produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the process called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce sperms by Spermatogenesis that begins at puberty. The spermatogonia (sing. spermatogonium) present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called primary spermatocytes periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division (reduction division) leading to formation of two equal, haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes, which have only 23 chromosomes each. The secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce four equal, haploid spermatids (Figure 3.5). What would be the number of chromosome in the spermatids? The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (sperms) by the process called spermiogenesis. After spermiogenesis, sperm heads become embedded in the Sertoli cells, and are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process called spermiation.

Valence band energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. AH energy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the conduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in the conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for the conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy gap [E9] between the top of valence band (EV) and the bottom of the conduction band EC. The electrons from valence band can be excited by heat, light or electrical energy to the conduction band and thus, produce a change in the current ﬂowing in a semiconductor. For insulators Eg> 3 eV, for semiconductors Eg is 0.2 eV to 3 eV, while for metals Eg z 0. p—n junction is the ‘key’ to all semiconductor devices. When such a junction is made. a ‘depletion layer’ is formed consisting of immobile ion—cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a junction potential barrier. By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be changed. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the battery and p—side is connected to the positive), the barrier is decreased while the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current is more [mA] while it is very small [11A] in a p-n junction diode. Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage to one direction). With the help of a capacitor or a suitable filter, a dc voltage can be obtained. There are some special purpose diodes. Zener diode is one such special purpose diode. In reverse bias, after a certain voltage. the current suddenly increases [breakdown voltage] in a Zener diode. This property has been used to obtain voltage regulation p—n junctions have also been used to obtain many photonic or optoelectronic devices where one of the participating entity is ‘photon’: (a) Photodiodes in which photon excitation results in a change of reverse saturation current which helps us to measure light intensity; (b) Solar cells which convert photon energy into electricity; [c] Light Emitting Diode and Diode Laser in which electron excitation by a bias voltage results in the generation of light. There are some special circuits which handle the digital data consisting of 0 and 1 levels. This forms the subject of Digital Electronics. The important digital circuits performing special logic operations are called logic gates. These are: OR, AND, NOT, NAND. and NOR gates. POINTS TO PONDER The energy bands (EC or EV) in the semiconductors are space delocalised which means that these are not located in any specific place inside the solid. The energies are the overall averages. When you see a picture in which EC or EV are drawn as straight lines, then they should be respectively taken simply as the bottom of conduction band energy levels and top of valence band energy levels. In elemental semiconductors (Si or Ge), the n—type or p—type semiconductors are obtained by introducing ‘dopants’ as defects. In compound semiconductors, the change in relative stoichiometric ratio can also change the type of semiconductor. For example. in ideal GaAs 2019-20",0

Have you ever thought about where and how the structures like roots, stems, leaves, ﬂowers, fruits and seeds arise and that too in an orderly sequence? You are, by now, aware of the terms seed, seedling, plantlet, mature plant. You have also seen that trees continue to increase in height or girth over a period of time. However, the leaves, ﬂowers and fruits of the same tree not only have limited dimensions but also appear and fall periodically and some time repeatedly. Why does vegetative phase precede ﬂowering in a plant? All plant organs are made up of a variety of tissues; is there any relationship between the structure of a cell, a tissue, an organ and the function they perform? Can the structure and the function of these be altered? All cells of a plant are descendents of the zygote. The question is, then, why and how do they have different structural and functional attributes? Development is the sum of two processes: growth and differentiation. To begin with, it is essential and sufficient to know that the development of a mature plant from a zygote (fertilised egg) follow a precise and highly ordered succession of events. During this process a complex body organisation is formed that produces roots, leaves, branches, ﬂowers, fruits, and seeds, and eventually they die (Figure 1 5.1). The first step in the process of plant growth is seed germination. The seed germinates when favourable conditions for growth exist in the environment. In absence of such favourable conditions the seeds do not germinate and goes into a period of suspended growth or rest. Once favourable conditions return, the seeds resume metabolic activities and growth takes place. In this chapter, you shall also study some of the factors which govern and control these developmental processes. These factors are both intrinsic (internal) and extrinsic (external) to the plant. 2019-2020",1

We cannot use a screw gauge or similar instruments. Even a microscope has certain limitations. An optical microscope uses visible light to ‘look’ at the system under investigation. As light has wave like features, the resolution to which an optical microscope can be used is the wavelength of light (A detailed explanation can be found in the Class XII Physics textbook). For visible light the range of wavelengths is from about 4000 A to 7000 A (1 angstrom = 1 A = 10'10 m). Hence an optical microscope cannot resolve particles with sizes smaller than this. Instead of visible light, we can use an electron beam. Electron beams can be focussed by properly designed electric and magnetic fields. The resolution of such an electron microscope is limited finally by the fact that electrons can also behave as waves ! (You will learn more about this in class XII). The wavelength of an electron can be as small as a fraction of an angstrom. Such electron microscopes with a resolution of 0.6 A have been built. They can almost resolve atoms and molecules in a material. In recent times, tunnelling microscopy has been developed in which again the limit of resolution is better than an angstrom. It is possible to estimate the sizes of molecules. A simple method for estimating the molecular size of oleic acid is given below. Oleic acid is a soapy liquid with large molecular size of the order of 10'9m. The idea is to first form mono-molecular layer of oleic acid on water surface. We dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to make a solution of 20 cm3. Then we take 1 cm3 2019-20 of this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using alcohol. So, the concentration of the solution is 1 20x20 solution. Next we lightly sprinkle some lycopodium powder on the surface of water in a large trough and we put one drop of this solution in the water. The oleic acid drop spreads into a thin, large and roughly circular film of molecular thickness on water surface. Then, we quickly measure the diameter of the thin film to get its area A. Suppose we have dropped n drops in the water. Initially, we determine the approximate volume of each drop (ch3). equal to ( )cm?’ of oleic acid/cm3 of Volume of n drops of solution = nV cm3 Amount of oleic acid in this solution =nV[ 1 jcm3 20x20 This solution of oleic acid spreads very fast on the surface of water and forms a very thin layer of thickness 1:. If this spreads to form a film of area A cm2, then the thickness of the film Volume of the film t : Area of the film 1: — n—ch 0“ _ 2o x20A (2'3) Ifwe assume that the ﬁlm has mono-molecular thickness, then this becomes the size or diameter of a molecule of oleic acid. The value of this thickness comes out to be of the order of 10'9 m. Example 2.5 If the size of a nucleus (in the range of 10‘15 to 10‘14 n1) is scaled up to the tip of a sharp pin. what roughly is the size of an atom ? Assume tip of the pin to be in the range lO’sm t0 10’4m. Answer The size of a nucleus is in the range of 10'15 m and 10'14 m. The tip of a sharp pin is taken to be in the range of 10'5 m and 10'4 m. Thus we are scaling up by a factor of 1010. An atom roughly of size 10'10 m will be scaled up to a size of 1 m. Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small in size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the centre of a sphere of radius about a metre long. 4",0

Nearly 99 per cent reabsorption of the ﬁltrate takes place through different parts of the nephrons. PCT is the major site of reabsorption and selective secretion. HL primarily helps to maintain osmolar gradient (300 mOsmolL‘1 - 1200 mOsmolL‘l) within the kidney interstitium. DOT and collecting duct allow extensive reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes, which help in osmoregulation: H’“, K’“ and NH3 could be secreted into the ﬁltrate by the tubules to maintain the ionic balance and pH of body ﬂuids. A counter current mechanism operates between the two limbs of the loop of Henle and those of vasa recta (capillary parallel to Henle’s loop). The ﬁltrate gets concentrated as it moves down the descending limb but is diluted by the ascending limb. Electrolytes and urea are retained in the interstitium by this arrangement. DOT and collecting duct concentrate the ﬁltrate about four times, i.e., from 300 mOsmolL‘1 to 1200 mOsmolL‘l, an excellent mechanism of conservation of water.

1151,1475,"Problems of Urban Settlements People ﬂock to cities to avail of employment opportunities and civic amenities. Since most cities in developing countries are unplanned, it creates severe congestion. Shortage of housing, vertical expansion and growth of slums are characteristic features of modern cities of developing countries. In many cities an increasing proportion of the population lives in substandard housing, e. g. slums and squatter settlements. In most million plus cities in India, one in four inhabitants lives in illegal settlements, which are growing twice as fast as the rest of the cities. Even in the Asia Pacific countries, around 60 per cent of the urban population lives in squatter settlements. Fig. 10.1 1 : Slums v What is a Healthy City? World Health Organisation (WHO) suggests that, among other things, a ‘healthy city’ must have: A ’Clean’ and ‘Safe’ environment. Meets the ‘Basic Needs’ of ‘All’ its inhabitants. Involves the ‘Community’ in local government. Provides easily accessible ‘Health’ service. I I 100 Fundamentals ofHuman Geography 2019—20 Economic Problems The decreasing employment opportunities in the rural as well as smaller urban areas of the developing countries consistently push the population to the urban areas. The enormous migrant population generates a pool of un- skilled and semi-skilled labour force, which is already saturated in urban areas. Socio-cultural Problems Cities in the developing countries suffer from several social ills. Insufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources fail to create adequate social infrastructure catering to the basic needs of the huge population. The available educational and health facilities remain beyond the reach of the urban poor. Health indices also, present a gloomy picture in cities of developing countries. Lack of employment and education tends to aggravate the crime rates. Male selective migration to the urban areas distorts the sex ratio in these cities. Environmental Problems The large urban population in developing countries not only uses but also disposes off a huge quantity of water and all types of waste materials. Many cities of the developing countries even find it extremely difﬁcult to provide the minimum required quantity of potable water and water for domestic and industrial uses. An improper sewerage system creates unhealthy conditions. Massive use of traditional fuel in the domestic as well as the industrial sector severely pollutes the air. The domestic and industrial wastes are either let into the general sewerages or dumped without treatment at unspecified locations. Huge concrete structures erected to accommodate the population and economic play a very conducive role to create heat islands. Urban Strategy The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has outlined these priorities as part of its ‘Urban Strategy’.",2

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Coronary Artery Disease, often referred to as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower. Angina: It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain appears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina can occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among the middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the blood ﬂow. Heart Failure: Heart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes called congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of the main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac arrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart muscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply). SUMMARY Vertebrates circulate blood, a ﬂuid connective tissue, in their body, to transport essential substances to the cells and to carry waste substances from there. Another ﬂuid, lymph (tissue ﬂuid) is also used for the transport of certain substances. Blood comprises of a ﬂuid matrix, plasma and formed elements. Red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes), white blood cells (WBCs, leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) constitute the formed elements. Blood of humans are grouped into A, B, AB and 0 systems based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens, A, B on the RBCs. Another blood grouping is also done based on the presence or absence of another antigen called Rhesus factor (Rh) on the surface of RBCs. The spaces between cells in the tissues contain a ﬂuid derived from blood called tissue ﬂuid. This ﬂuid called lymph is almost similar to blood except for the protein content and the formed elements. All vertebrates and a few invertebrates have a closed circulatory system. Our circulatory system consists of a muscular pumping organ, heart, a network of vessels and a ﬂuid, blood. Heart has two atria and two ventricles. Cardiac musculature is auto-excitable. Sino-atrial node (SAN) generates the maximum number of action protentials per minute (70-75 / min) and therefore, it sets the pace of the activities of the heart. Hence it is called the Pacemaker. The action potential causes the atria and then the ventricles to undergo contraction (systole) followed by their relaxation (diastole). ’Ihe systole forces the blood to move ﬁ'om the atria to the ventricles and to the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The cardiac cycle is formed by sequential events in the heart which is cyclically repeated and is called the cardiac cycle. A healthy person shows 72 such cycles per minute. About 7 0 mL of blood is pumped out by each ventricle during a cardiac cycle and it is called the stroke or beat volume. Volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle of heart per minute is called the cardiac output and it is equal to the product of stroke volume and heart rate (approx 5 litres). The electrical activity of the heart can be recorded ﬁ‘om",1

By charge conservation, conductor 2 has charge —Q at the end (Fig 2.30 ). In transferring positive charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at any stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than conductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we ﬁrst calculate the work done in a small step involving transfer of an inﬁnitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small) amount of charge. Consider the intermediate situation when the conductors l and 2 have charges Q’ and —Q’respectively. At this stage, the potential difference V’between conductors 1 to 2 is Q’/ C, where C is the capacitance of the system. Next imagine that a small charge 6 Q’ is transferred from conductor 2 to 1. Work done in this step (6 W’), resulting in charge Q’ on conductor 1 increasing to Q’+ 6 Q’, is given by Q’ 6W=V’5 ’= Q C 5 Q’ (2.68) 2019-20",0

The phrase ‘calculate the work done' is incomplete. We should refer [or imply clearly by context) to the work done by a speciﬁc force or a group of forces on a given body over a certain displacement. Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and kinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction or viscous force on a moving body is negative. For two bodies. the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from Newton‘s Third Law. F + F = 0 12 21 But the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel. Le. W12+ W21¢ 0 However. it may sometimes be true. The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of the force is not known. This is clear from Example 6.2 where the WE theorem is used in such a situation. The WE theorem is not independent of Newton's Second Law. The WE theorem may be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the WE theorem for conservative forces. The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non— inertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the net force acting on the body under consideration. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always undetermined upto a constant. For example. the point where the potential energy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational potential energy mgh, the zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring potential energy 1063/2 . the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position of the oscillating mass. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential energy. For example. work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no potential energy can be associated with friction. During a collision : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of the collision ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation [even if the collision is elastic) applies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision. In fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may be momentarily at rest with respect to each other. 2019-20 133",0

Potential energr of two charges q1, q2 at r1, r2 is given by 1 U = Q1 (12 lingo r12 where r12 is distance between q1 and q2. The potential energy of a charge q in an external potential V[r] is qV(r). The potential energy of a dipole moment p in a uniform electric field E is —p.E. Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside the surface of a charged conductor, E is normal to the surface given by 0'- E = 8—“ where {1 is the unit vector along the outward normal to the 0 surface and 0' is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can reside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface of a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor [with no charges), the electric field is zero. A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its capacitance is defined by C = Q/ V, where Q and —Q are the charges on the two conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is determined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative positions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is faradz, 1 F = 1 C V'l. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the plates), C—sA _0_ d where A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them. If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is ﬁlled with an insulating substance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces a net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation, gives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside the dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is thus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value C0 when there is no medium (vacuum), C = KCo where K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.

During the early and mid-twentieth century, the American Telegraph and Telephone Company (AT&T) enjoyed a monopoly over U.S.A.’s telephone industry. In fact, the telephone became a critical factor in the urbanisation of America. Firms centralised their functioning at city- headquarters and located their branch offices in smaller towns. Even today, the telephone is the most commonly used mode. In developing countries, the use of cell phones, made possible by satellites, is important for rural connectivity. Today there is a phenomenal pace of development. The ﬁrst major breakthrough is the use of optic ﬁber cables (OFC). Faced with mounting competition, telephone companies all",2

1161,1082,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS carbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose and fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these two monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic pathway. Glucose and fructose are phosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6- phosphate by the activity of the enzyme hexokinase. This phosphorylated form of glucose then isomerises to produce fructose-6- phosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of glucose and ﬁ‘uctose are same. The various steps of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 14.1. In glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the control of different enzymes, takes place to produce pyruvate from glucose. While studying the steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at which utilisation or synthesis of AT P or (in this case) NADH + H+ take place. ATP is utilised at two steps: ﬁrst in the conversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate and second in the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate. The fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is split into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We find that there is one step where NADH + H+ is formed from NAD+; this is when 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted to 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA). Two redox—equivalents are removed (in the form of two hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred to a molecule of NAD+. PGAL is oxidised and with inorganic phosphate to get converted into BPGA. The conversion of BPGA to 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energy yielding process; this energy is trapped by the formation of ATP. Another ATP is synthesised during the conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid. Can you then calculate how many ATP molecules are directly synthesised in this pathway from one glucose molecule? Pyruvic acid is then the key product of glycolysis. What is the metabolic fate of pyruvate? This depends on the cellular need. 229 Glucose ( C) ADP Glucose-B-phosphate (6C) Fructose-{phosphate _ (60) ADP Fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (6C) Triose phosphate Triose phosphate *— -- (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) ""l“ (Dlhydey acetone (30) phosphate) NAD+ (3c) Km 2 x Triose bisphosphate (1,3 bisphosphoglyceric acid) (30) ADP 2 X Triose phosphate (3-phosphog1yceric acid) (3C) 1 2 x 2-phosphog1ycerate ma 2 x phosphoenolpyruvate ADP >1 2 X Pyruvic acid (3C) Figure 14.1 Steps of glycolysis",1

The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal is expressed in units of microseconds (10'6 s) abbreviated as us. On the other hand, the orbital period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days. The Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years. The reciprocal of T gives the number of repetitions that occur per unit time. This quantity is called the frequency of the periodic motion. It is represented by the symbol v. The relation between v and T is v =1/T (14.1) The unit of v is thus S'l. After the discoverer of radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857— 1894), a special name has been given to the unit of frequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz). Thus, 1 hertz = 1 Hz = l oscillation per second =IS'1 ( 1 4. 2) Note, that the frequency, v, is not necessarily an integer.

In this chapter, we use the term displacement in a more general sense. It refers to change with time of any physical property under consideration. For example, in case of rectilinear motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance from the starting point as a function of time is its position displacement. The choice of origin is a matter of convenience. Consider a block attached to a spring, the other end of the spring is fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig. l4.2(a)]. Generally, it is convenient to measure displacement of the body from its equilibrium position. For an oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the vertical as a function of time may be regarded as a displacement variable [see Fig. l4.2(b)]. The term displacement is not always to be referred Fig. 14.2(a) A block attached to a spring, the other end of which is ﬁxed to a rigid wall. The block moves on a frictionless surface. The motion of the block can be described in terms of its distance or displacement x from the equilibrium position. {.

There can be many other kinds of displacement variables. The voltage across a capacitor, changing with time in an AC circuit, is also a displacement variable. In the same way, pressure variations in time in the propagation of sound wave, the changing electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are examples of displacement in different contexts. The displacement variable may take both positive and negative values. In experiments on oscillations, the displacement is measured for different times. The displacement can be represented by a mathematical function of time. In case of periodic motion, this function is periodic in time. One of the simplest periodic functions is given by f(t) = A cos cot (14.3a) If the argument of this function, cut, is increased by an integral multiple of 27rradians, 2019-20",0

Cilia are small structures which work like oars, causing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding ﬂuid. Flagella are comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The prokaryotic bacteria also possess ﬂagella but these are structurally different from that of the eukaryotic ﬂagella. The electron microscopic study of a cilium or the ﬂagellum show that they are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme, possesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis. The axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral microtubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an arrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array (Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also enclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of each peripheral doublets by a radial spoke.

He observed that the motion of the chandelier was periodic. The system is a kind of pendulum. You can also make your own pendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long unstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm long. Suspend your pendulum from a suitable support so that it is free to oscillate. Displace the stone to one side by a small distance and let it go. The stone executes a to and fro motion, it is periodic with a period of about two seconds. We shall show that this periodic motion is simple harmonic for small displacements from the mean position. Consider simple pendulum — a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible massless string of length L. The other end of the string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob oscillates in a plane about the vertical line through the support. Fig. 14.18(a) shows this system.

1170,1275,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS is detrimental to the other species (host and prey, respectively). The interaction where one species is beneﬁtted and the other is neither beneﬁtted nor harmed is called commensalism. In amensalism on the other hand one species is harmed whereas the other is unaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common characteristic— the interacting species live closely together. (i) Predation: What would happen to all the energy fixed by autotrophic organisms if the community has no animals to eat the plants? You can think of predation as nature’s way of transferring to higher trophic levels the energy ﬁxed by plants. When we think of predator and prey, most probably it is the tiger and the deer that readily come to our mind, but a sparrow eating any seed is no less a predator. Although animals eating plants are categorised separately as herbivores, they are, in a broad ecological context, not very different from predators. Besides acting as ‘conduits’ for energy transfer across trophic levels, predators play other important roles. They keep prey populations under control. But for predators, prey species could achieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem instability. When certain exotic species are introduced into a geographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast because the invaded land does not have its natural predators. The prickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920’s caused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of rangeland. Finally, the invasive cactus was brought under control only after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat was introduced into the country. Biological control methods adopted in agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator to regulate prey population. Predators also help in maintaining species diversity in a community, by reducing the intensity of competition among competing prey species. In the rocky intertidal communities of the American Paciﬁc Coast the starﬁsh Pisaster is an important predator. In a ﬁeld experiment, when all the starﬁsh were removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species of invertebrates became extinct within a year, because of inter- speciﬁc competition. If a predator is too efﬁcient and overexploits its prey, then the prey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also become extinct for lack of food. This is the reason why predators in nature are ‘prudent’. Prey species have evolved various defenses to lessen the impact of predation. Some species of insects and frogs are cryptically—coloured (camouﬂaged) to avoid being detected easily by the predator. Some are poisonous and therefore avoided by the 2019—2020 233",1

After the characteristic voltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the threshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~O.2V for germanium diode and ~0.7 V for silicon diode). For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~uA) and almost remains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation current. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down voltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode is discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not used beyond the reverse saturation current region. The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly allows the ﬂow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward bias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This property is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next section. For diodes, we define a quantity called dynamic resistance as the ratio of small change in voltage AV to a small change in current AI: _AV r__ d AI (14.6) Example 14.4 The V-I characteristic of a silicon diode is shown in the Fig. 14.17.

Bees, butterﬂies, ﬂies, beetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds (sunbirds and humming birds) and bats are the common pollinating agents. (Figure 2.1 lb). Among the animals, insects, particularly bees are the dominant biotic pollinating agents. Even larger animals such as some primates (lemurs), arboreal (tree-dwelling) rodents, or even reptiles (gecko lizard and garden lizard) have also been reported as pollinators in some species. Often ﬂowers of animal- pollinated plants are speciﬁcally adapted for a particular species of animal. Majority of insect-pollinated ﬂowers are large, colourful, fragrant and rich in nectar. When the ﬂowers are small, a number of ﬂowers are clustered into an inﬂorescence to make them conspicuous. Animals are attracted to ﬂowers by colour and / or fragrance. The ﬂowers pollinated by ﬂies and beetles secrete foul odours to attract these animals. To sustain animal visits, the ﬂowers have to provide rewards to the animals. Nectar and pollen grains are the usual ﬂoral rewards. For harvesting the reward(s) from the ﬂower the animal visitor comes in contact with the anthers and the stigma. The body of the animal gets a coating of pollen grains, which are generally sticky in animal pollinated ﬂowers. When the animal carrying — pollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about pollination. In some species ﬂoral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs; an example is that of the tallest ﬂower of Amorphophallus (the ﬂower itself is about 6 feet in height).

The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The field at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e., along the radius vector). (i) Field outside the shell: Consider a point P outside the shell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the Surface charge,/ ------- /\ Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre densityc ’ O, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent relative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric ﬁeld at each point of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude E and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and AS at every point are parallel and the ﬂux through each element is E AS. Summing over all AS, the ﬂux through the Gaussian surface is E X 4 at r2. The charge enclosed is Gaussian surface o X 4 at R2.

Thus for points outside the shell, the field due to a uniformly charged shell is as if the entire charge of the shell is concentrated at its centre.

Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross each other, because otherwise the direction of ﬁeld at the point of intersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure. Magnetostatic ﬁeld lines can never form closed loops around empty space. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a region across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic field lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space, nor when the loop encloses charges. Right. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid. Nothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each loop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for clarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been shown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings contains magnetic field. Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot be so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates Ampere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet eventually to form closed loops. Right. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note carefully the direction of ﬁeld lines inside. Not all field lines emanate out of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both the N-pole, and the S-pole, the net ﬂux of the ﬁeld is zero. Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic ﬁeld. Look at the upper region. All the ﬁeld lines seem to emanate out of the shaded plate. The net ﬂux through a surface surrounding the shaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic ﬁeld. The given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines around a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged lower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.7 (e) and (f)] should be carefully grasped. Wrong. Magnetic ﬁeld lines between two pole pieces cannot be precisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable. Otherwise, Ampere’s law is violated. This is also true for electric field lines. Example 5.7 (a) (b) (C) (d) (e) Magnetic ﬁeld lines show the direction (at every point) along which a small magnetised needle aligns (at the point). Do the magnetic ﬁeld lines also represent the lines of force on a moving charged particle at every point? Magnetic ﬁeld lines can be entirely confined within the core of a toroid, but not within a straight solenoid. Why? If magnetic monopoles existed, how would the Gauss’s law of magnetism be modiﬁed? Does a bar magnet exert a torque on itself due to its own field? Does one element of a current-carrying wire exert a force on another element of the same wire? Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a system have magnetic moments even though its net charge is zero? Solution (a) No. The magnetic force is always normal to B (remember magnetic force = qv X B). It is misleading to call magnetic ﬁeld lines as lines of force. 2019-20",0

Exchange of gases also occur between blood and tissues. 02 and CO2 are exchanged in these sites by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure / concentration gradient. Solubility of the gases as well as the thickness of the membranes involved in diffusion are also some important factors that can affect the rate of diffusion. Pressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is called partial pressure and is represented as p02 for oxygen and pCO2 for carbon dioxide. Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmospheric air and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 1 7.1 and in Figure 1 7.3. The data given in the table clearly indicates a concentration gradient for oxygen from alveoli to blood and blood to tissues.

1180,79,"l Physics output. This is what happens in a nuclear reactor. If the chain reaction is uncontrolled, it leads to explosive energy output, as in a nuclear bomb. There is, however, a hurdle in sustaining a chain reaction, as described here. It is known experimentally that slow neutrons (thermal neutrons) are much more likely to cause fission in 2325U than fast neutrons. Also fast neutrons liberated in ﬁssion would escape instead of causing another ﬁssion reaction. The average energy of a neutron produced in fission of 25’25U is 2 MeV. These neutrons unless slowed down will escape from the reactor without interacting with the uranium nuclei, unless a very large amount of fissionable material is used for sustaining the chain reaction. What one needs to do is to slow down the fast neutrons by elastic scattering with light nuclei. In fact, Chadwick’s experiments showed that in an elastic collision with hydrogen the neutron almost comes to rest and proton carries away the energy. This is the same situation as when a marble hits head-on an identical marble at rest. Therefore, in reactors, light nuclei called moderators are provided along with the fissionable nuclei for slowing down fast neutrons. The moderators commonly used are water, heavy water (D20) and graphite. The Apsara reactor at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, uses water as moderator. The other Indian reactors, which are used for power production, use heavy water as moderator. Because of the use of moderator, it is possible that the ratio, K, of number of fission produced by a given generation of neutrons to the number of fission of the preceeding generation may be greater than one. This ratio is called the multiplication factor; it is the measure of the growth rate of the neutrons in the reactor. For K = 1, the operation of the reactor is said to be critical, which is what we wish it to be for steady power operation. If K becomes greater than one, the reaction rate and the reactor power increases exponentially. Unless the factor K is brought down very close to unity, the reactor will become supercritical and can even explode. The explosion of the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine in 1986 is a sad reminder that accidents in a nuclear reactor can be catastrophic. The reaction rate is controlled through control-rods made out of neutron-absorbing material such as cadmium. In addition to control rods, reactors are provided with safety rods which, when required, can be inserted into the reactor and K can be reduced rapidly to less than unity. The more abundant isotope 2§§U in naturally occurring uranium is non-fissionable.

1181,1092,"HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE Widal test : A classic case in medicine, that of Mary Mallon nicknamed ’Iyphoid Mary, is worth mentioning here. She was a cook by profession and was a typhoid carrier who continued to spread typhoid for several years through the food she prepared. Bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae are responsible for the disease pneumonia in humans which infects the alveoli (air ﬁlled sacs) of the lungs. As a result of the infection, the alveoli get ﬁlled with ﬂuid leading to severe problems in respiration. The symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache. In severe cases, the lips and ﬁnger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour. A healthy person acquires the infection by inhaling the droplets / aerosols released by an infected person or even by sharing glasses and utensils with an infected person. Dysentery, plague, diphtheria, etc., are some of the other bacterial diseases in man. Many viruses also cause diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses represent one such group of viruses which cause one of the most infectious human ailments — the common cold. They infect the nose and respiratory passage but not the lungs. The common cold is characterised by nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, tiredness, etc., which usually last for 3-7 days. Droplets resulting from cough or sneezes of an infected person are either inhaled directly or transmitted through contaminated objects such as pens, books, cups, doorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse, etc., and cause infection in a healthy person. Some of the human diseases are caused by protozoans too. You might have heard about malaria, a disease man has been ﬁghting since many years. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan is responsible for this disease. Different species of Plasmodium (P. vivax, P. malaria and P. falciparum) are responsible for different types of malan'a. Of these, malignant malaria caused by Plasmodiumfalciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal. Let us take a glance at the life cycle of Plasmodium (Figure 8.1). Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites (infectious form) through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasites initially multiply within the liver cells and then attack the red blood cells (RBCs) resulting in their rupture. The rupture of RBCs is associated with release of a toxic substance, haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill and high fever recurring every three to four days. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, these parasites enter the mosquito’s body and undergo further development. The parasites multiply within them to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands. When these mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into his / her body, thereby initiating the events mentioned above. It is interesting to note that the malarial parasite requires two hosts — human and mosquitoes — to complete its life cycle (Figure 8.1); the female Anopheles mosquito is the vector (transmitting agent) too. 2019-2020 147",1
1182,362,"SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTA'I‘IONAL MOTION We shall now define another product of two vectors. This product is a vector. Two important quantities in the study of rotational motion, namely, moment of a force and angular momentum, are defined as vector products. Deﬁnition of Vector Product A vector product of two vectors a and b is a vector c such that (i) magnitude of c = c = ab sin 0 where a and b are magnitudes of a and b and 6 is the angle between the two vectors. (ii) c is perpendicular to the plane containing a and b. (iii) if we take a right handed screw with its head lying in the plane of a and b and the screw perpendicular to this plane, and if we turn the head in the direction from a to b, then the tip of the screw advances in the direction of c. This right handed screw rule is illustrated in Fig. 7 . 15a. Alternately, if one curls up the fingers of right hand around a line perpendicular to the plane of the vectors a and b and if the fingers are curled up in the direction from a to b, then the stretched thumb points in the direction of c, as shown in Fig. 7.15b. Tc=axb I I ‘r :5 ‘J ‘1 v :5 v (a) (b) Fig. 7.15 (a) Rule of the right handed screw for defining the direction of the vector product of two vectors. (b) Rule of the right hand for deﬁning the direction of the vector product. A simpler version of the right hand rule is the following : Open up your right hand palm and curl the fingers pointing from a to b. Your stretched thumb points in the direction of c. It should be remembered that there are two angles between any two vectors a and b . In Fig. 7 .15 (a) or (b) they correspond to 6 (as shown) and (3600— 6). While applying either of the above rules, the rotation should be taken through the smaller angle (<1800) between a and b. It is 0 here. Because of the cross (x) used to denote the vector product, it is also referred to as cross product. 0 Note that scalar product of two vectors is commutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a The vector product, however, is not commutative, i.e. aXb #2 bXa The magnitude of both aXb and bXa is the same (ab sing): also, both of them are perpendicular to the plane of a and b. But the rotation of the right-handed screw in case of aXb is from a to b, whereas in case of bXa it is from b to a. This means the two vectors are in opposite directions. We have a x b = —b x a 0 Another interesting property of a vector product is its behaviour under reﬂection. Under reﬂection (i.e. on taking the plane mirror image) we have x —> —x,y —> —y and z —> —z. As a result all the components of a vector change sign and thus a —> —a, b —> —b . What happens to aXb under reﬂection? aXb—>(—a)><(—b)=a><b Thus, aXb does not change sign under reﬂection. 0 Both scalar and vector products are distributive with respect to vector addition. Thus, a.(b + c) = a.b + a.c ax(b+c)=a><b+a><c 0 We may write c = aXb in the component form. For this we first need to obtain some elementary cross products: (i) mm = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector with zero magnitude) This follows since magnitude of aXa is a2 sin0°=0- 2019-20",0

How much parallax would this star (named Alpha Centauri] show when viewed from two locations of the Earth six months apart in its orbit around the Sun ? 2.21 Precise measurements of physical quantities are a need of science. For example, to ascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its positions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind the discovery of radar in World War 11. Think of different examples in modern science where precise measurements of length, time, mass etc. are needed. Also, wherever you can, give a quantitative idea of the precision needed. 2.22 Just as precise measurements are necessary in science, it is equally important to be able to make rough estimates of quantities using rudimentary ideas and common observations. Think of ways by which you can estimate the following [where an estimate is difficult to obtain, try to get an upper bound on the quantity] : (a) the total mass of rain—bearing clouds over India during the Monsoon [b] the mass of an elephant [c] the wind speed during a storm (d) the number of strands of hair on your head [e] the number of air molecules in your classroom. 2.23 The Sun is a hot plasma [ionized matter] with its inner core at a temperature exceeding 107 K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high temperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you expect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and liquids or gases ?

A student derives the following relation between 0 and v : tan 0 = v and checks that the relation has a correct limit: as 1) —>0, 0 —>0, as expected. We are assuming there is no strong wind and that the rain falls vertically for a stationary man). Do you think this relation can be correct ? If not, guess the correct relation. 2.26 It is claimed that two cesium clocks, if allowed to run for 100 years, free from any disturbance, may differ by only about 0.02 s. What does this imply for the accuracy of the standard cesium clock in measuring a time—interval of l s ? 2.27 Estimate the average mass density of a sodium atom assuming its size to be about 2.5 A.

Are the two densities of the same order of magnitude ? If so, why ? 2.28 The unit of length convenient on the nuclear scale is a fermi : 1 f = 10’15m. Nuclear sizes obey roughly the following empirical relation : = 1/3 r r0 A where r is the radius of the nucleus, A its mass number, and r0 is a constant equal to about, 1.2 f.

1184,131,"Magnetism and Mo’r’rer POINTS TO PONDER l. A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving charges / currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological exploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific understanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is not a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science and engineering go hand—in—hand, one leading and assisting the other in tandem. 2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get two smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative charges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the electronic charge with value |e| = 1.6 ><lO~19 C. All other charges are integral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is quantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why electric charge is quantised. 3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that the magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast, the electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate on the negative charge [or fade out at infinity). 4. The earth’s magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it. The earth's core is hot and molten. Perhaps convective currents in this core are responsible for the earth’s magnetic field. As to what ‘dynamo’ effect sustains this current, and why the earth’s field reverses polarity every million years or so, we do not know. 5. A miniscule difference in the value of x, the magnetic susceptibility, yields radically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For diamagnetic materials )5 = —10”5 whereas 95 = +10'5 for paramagnetic materials. 6. There exists a perfect diamagnet, namely, a superconductor. This is a metal at very low temperatures. In this case x = —1, ,ur = 0, ,u = 0. The external magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material is also a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory which ties these two properties together. A quantum—mechanical theory by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer [BCS theory] explains these effects. The BCS theory was proposed in1957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel Prize in physics in 1970. 7. The phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is reminiscent of similar behaviour concerning the elastic properties of materials. Strain may not be proportional to stress; here H and B [or M] are not linearly related. The stress—strain curve exhibits hysteresis and area enclosed by it represents the energy dissipated per unit volume. A similar interpretation can be given to the B—H magnetic hysteresis curve. 8. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it is weak and hard to detect if the substance is para— or ferromagnetic. 9. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic material such as ferrimagnetic, anti—ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with properties which are exotic and mysterious. 199 2019-20",0
1185,945,"REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SUMMARY Reproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Our nation was the first nation in the world to initiate various action plans at national level towards attaining a reproductively healthy society. Counselling and creating awareness among people about reproductive organs, adolescence and associated changes, safe and hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including AIDS, etc., is the primary step towards reproductive health. Providing medical facilities and care to the problems like menstrual irregularities, pregnancy related aspects, delivery, medical termination of pregnancy, STIs, birth control, infertility, post natal child and maternal management is another important aspect of the Reproductive and Child Health Care programmes. An overall improvement in reproductive health has taken place in our country as indicated by reduced maternal and infant mortality rates, early detection and cure of STIs, assistance to infertile couples, etc. Improved health facilities and better living conditions promoted an explosive growth of population. Such a growth necessitated intense propagation of contraceptive methods. Various contraceptive options are available now such as natural, traditional, barrier, IUDs, pills, injectables, implants and surgical methods. Though contraceptives are not regular requirements for reproductive health, one is forced to use them to avoid pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy. Medical termination of pregnancy is legalised in our country. MTP is generally performed to get rid of unwanted pregnancy due to rapes, casual relationship, etc., as also in cases when the continuation of pregnancy could be harmful or even fatal to either the mother, or the foetus or both. Infections or diseases transmitted through sexual intercourse are called Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STIs). Pelvic Inﬂammatory Diseases (PIDs), still birth, infertility are some of the complications of them. Early detection facilitate better cure of these diseases. Avoiding sexual intercourse with unknown/multiple partners, use of condoms during coitus are some of the simple precautions to avoid contracting STIs. Inability to conceive or produce children even after 2 years of unprotected sexual cohabitation is called infertility. Various methods are now available to help such couples. In Vitro fertilisation followed by transfer of embryo into the female genital tract is one such method and is commonly known as the Test Tube Baby’ Programme. 2019—2020 \\V/IW",1

These substances have to be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn the mechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis on common nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major forms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is the most toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination, whereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimum loss of water. The process of excreting ammonia is Ammonotelism Many bony ﬁshes, aquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are ammonotelic in nature. Ammonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion across body surfaces or through gill surfaces (in ﬁsh) as ammonium ions. Kidneys do not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptation necessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like urea and uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrial amphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called ureotelic animals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in the liver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered and excreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in the kidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity. Reptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and are called uricotelic animals. 2019-2020",1

Luckily we have many threads which weave the different areas of biological information into a unifying principle. Ecology is one such thread which gives us a holistic perspective to biology. The essence of biological understanding is to know how organisms, while remaining an individual, interact with other organisms and physical habitats as a group and hence behave like organised wholes, i.e., population, community, ecosystem or even as the whole biosphere. Ecology explains to us all this. A particular aspect of this is the study of anthropogenic environmental degradation and the socio-political issues it has raised.

Such conversion results in the production of carbohydrate, glucose that may be converted to other organic compounds such as sucrose, starch, cellulose, etc. Here, some of the carbohydrates are utilised directly by the plant itself. During this process, more carbon dioxide is generated and is released through its leaves or roots during the day. The remaining carbohydrates not being utilised by the plant become part of the plant tissue. Plant tissues are either being eaten by the herbivorous animals or get decomposed by the micro- organisms. The herbivores convert some of the consumed carbohydrates into carbon dioxide for release into the air through respiration. The micro-organisms decompose the remaining carbohydrates after the animal dies. The carbohydrates that are decomposed by the micro-organisms then get oxidised into carbon dioxide and are returned to the atmosphere (Figure 15.2).

In most cases, they reissue such shares which may be at par, at premium or at a discount. Forfeited shares may be reissued as fully paid at a par, premium, discount. In this context, it may be noted that the amount of discount allowed cannot exceed the amount that had been received on forfeited shares at the time of initial issue, and that the discount allowed on reissue of forfeited shares should be debited to the ‘Forfeited Share Account'. The balance, if any, left in the Share—Forfeited Account relating to reissued Shares, should be treated as capital proﬁt and transferred to Capital Reserve Account. For example, when a company forfeits 200 shares of Rs. 10 each on which Rs. 600 had been received, it can allow a maximum discount of Rs. 600 on their reissue. Assuming that the company reissues these shares for Rs. 1,800 as fully paid, the necessary journal entry will be: Bank A/c Dr. 1,800 Share Forfeiture A/c Dr. 200 To Share Capital A/c 2,000 (Reissue of 200 forfeited shares at Rs. 9 per share as fully paid) This shall leave a balance of Rs. 400 in share forfeited account which should be transferred to Capital Reserve Account by recording the following journal entry: Share Forfeiture A/c Dr. 400 To Capital Reserve 400 (Proﬁt on reissue of forfeited shares transferred) Another important point to be noted in this context is that the capital proﬁt arises only in respect of the foreﬁted share reissued, and not on all forefeited shares. Hence, when a part of the forfeited shares are reissued, the whole balance of share forfeiture account cannot be transferred to the capital reserve. In such",3

It is a device whose principle can be understood on the basis of our discussion in Section 4.10. The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate about a fixed axis (Fig. 4.24), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is a cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the ﬁeld radial but also increases the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. When a current ﬂows through the coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.26) to be 17 = N1 AB where the symbols have their usual meaning. Since the field is radial by design, we have taken sin 9 = 1 in the above expression for the torque. The magnetic torque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring SP provides a counter torque k¢ that balances the magnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a steady angular deﬂection ¢. In equilibrium k¢ = NIAB where k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the restoring torque per unit twist. The deﬂection ¢ is indicated on the scale by a pointer attached to the spring. We have ¢ = ($)1 (4.38) The quantity in brackets is a constant for a given galvanometer. The galvanometer can be used in a number of ways. It can be used as a detector to check if a current is ﬂowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage in the Wheatstone’s bridge arrangement. In this usage the neutral position of the pointer (when no current is ﬂowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of the scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.24. Depending on the direction of the current, the pointer’s deﬂection is either to the right or the left. The galvanometer cannot as such be used as an ammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-scale deﬂection for a current of the order of ,uA. (ii) For measuring currents, the galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large resistance, this will change Permanent magnet Uniform radial the value of the current in the circuit. To overcome magnetic ﬁeld these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance rs, called shunt resistance, in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the current passes through the shunt.

(5.5) F = ma = mg Thus the given equation describes the motion of a particle under acceleration due to gravity and y is the position coordinate in the direction of g. 4 Impulse We sometimes encounter examples where a large force acts for a very short duration producing a finite change in momentum of the body. For example, when a ball hits a wall and bounces back, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a very short time when the two are in contact, yet the force is large enough to reverse the momentum of the ball. Often, in these situations, the force and the time duration are difficult to ascertain separately. However, the product of force and time, which is the change in momentum of the body remains a measurable quantity. This product is called impulse: Impulse = Force X time duration = Change in momentum (5.7) A large force acting for a short time to produce a finite change in momentum is called an impulsive force. In the history of science, impulsive forces were put in a conceptually different category from 2019-20 ordinary forces. Newtonian mechanics has no such distinction. Impulsive force is like any other force — except that it is large and acts for a short time. > Example 5.4 A batsman hits back a ball straight in the direction of the bowler without changing its initial speed of 12 m S’l. If the mass of the ball is O. 15 kg, determine the impulse imparted to the ball. (Assume linear motion of the ball) Answer Change in momentum = 0.15 X 12—(—0.15X12) = 3.6Ns, Impulse = 3.6 N s, in the direction from the batsman to the bowler. This is an example where the force on the ball by the batsman and the time of contact of the ball and the bat are difficult to know, but the impulse is readily calculated. 4 5.6 NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION The second law relates the external force on a body to its acceleration. What is the origin of the external force on the body ? What agency provides the external force ? The simple answer in Newtonian mechanics is that the external force on a body always arises due to some other body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives rise to an external force on A. A natural question is: Does A in turn give rise to an external force on B ? In some examples, the answer seems clear. If you press a coiled spring, the spring is compressed by the force of your hand. The compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your hand and you can feel it. But what if the bodies are not in contact ? The earth pulls a stone downwards due to gravity. Does the stone exert a force on the earth ? The answer is not obvious since we hardly see the effect of the stone on the earth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes, the stone does exert an equal and opposite force on the earth. We do not notice it since the earth is very massive and the effect of a small force on its motion is negligible. Thus, according to Newtonian mechanics, force never occurs singly in nature. Force is the mutual interaction between two bodies. Forces",0

Development involves a larval stage called tadpole. Tadpole undergoes metamorphosis to form the adult. Frogs are beneﬁcial for mankind because they eat insects and protect the crop. Frogs maintain ecological balance because these serve as an important link of food chain and food web in the ecosystem. In some countries the muscular legs of frog are used as food by man. SUMMARY Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that ensures the survival of the body as a whole and exhibit division of labour. A tissue is deﬁned as group of cells along with intercellular substances performing one or more functions in the body. Epithelia are sheet like tissues lining the body’s surface and its cavities, ducts and tubes. Epithelia have one free surface facing a body ﬂuid or the outside environment. Their cells are structurally and functionally connected at junctions. Diverse types of connective tissues bind together, support, strengthen, protect, and insulate other tissue in the body. Soft connective tissues consist of protein ﬁbres as well as a variety of cells arranged in a ground substance. Cartilage, bone, blood, and adipose tissue are specialised connective tissues. Cartilage and bone are both structural materials. Blood is a ﬂuid tissue with transport functions. Adipose tissue is a reservoir of stored energy. Muscle tissue, which can contract (shorten) in response to stimulation, helps in movement of the body and speciﬁc body parts. Skeletal muscle is the muscle tissue attached to bones. Smooth muscle is a component of internal organs. Cardiac muscle makes up the contractile walls of the heart. Connective tissue covers all three types of tissues. Nervous tissue exerts greatest control over the response of body. Neurons are the basic units of nervous tissue. Earthworm, Cockroach and Frog show characteristic features in body organisation. In Pheretima posthuma (earthworm), the body is covered by cuticle. All segments of its body are alike except the 14m, 1 5‘11 and 1 6‘11 segment, which are thick and dark and glandular, forming clitellum. A ring of S-shaped chitinous setae is found in each segment. These setae help in locomotion. On the ventral side spermathecal openings are present in between the grooves of 5 and 6, 6 and 7, 7 and 8 and 8 and 9 segments. Female genital pores are present on 14th segment and male genital pores on 18th segment. The alimentary canal is a narrow tube made of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, gizzard, stomach, intestine and anus. The blood vascular system is of closed type with heart and valves. Nervous system is represented by ventral nerve cord. Earthworm is hermaphorodite. Two pairs of",1
1195,910,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS (iii) Migrate: The organism can move away temporarily from the stressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when stressful period is over. In human analogy, this strategy is like a person moving from Delhi to Shimla for the duration of summer. Many animals, particularly birds, during winter undertake long— distance migrations to more hospitable areas. Every winter the famous Keolado National Park (Bharatpur) in Raj asthan host thousands of migratory birds coming from Siberia and other extremely cold northern regions. (iv) Suspend: In bacteria, fungi and lower plants, various kinds of thick- walled spores are formed which help them to survive unfavourable conditions — these germinate on availability of suitable environment. In higher plants, seeds and some other vegetative reproductive structures serve as means to tide over periods of stress besides helping in dispersal — they germinate to form new plants under favourable moisture and temperature conditions. They do so by reducing their metabolic activity and going into a state of ‘dormancy’. In animals, the organism, if unable to migrate, might avoid the stress by escaping in time. The familiar case of bears going into hibernation during winter is an example of escape in time. Some snails and fish go into aestivation to avoid summer—related problems-heat and dessication. Under unfavourable conditions many zooplankton species in lakes and ponds are known to enter diapause, a stage of suspended development. 13. 1.3 Adaptations While considering the various alternatives available to organisms for coping with extremes in their environment, we have seen that some are able to respond through certain physiological adjustments while others do so behaviourally (migrating temporarily to a less stressful habitat). These responses are also actually, their adaptations. So, we can say that adaptation is any attribute of the organism (morphological, physiological, behavioural) that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its habitat. Many adaptations have evolved over a long evolutionary time and are genetically ﬁxed. In the absence of an external source of water, the kangaroo rat in North American deserts is capable of meeting all its water requirements through its internal fat oxidation (in which water is a by product). It also has the ability to concentrate its urine so that minimal volume of water is used to remove excretory products. Many desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and have their stomata arranged in deep pits (sunken) to minimise water loss through transpiration. They also have a special photosynthetic pathway (CAM) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time. Some desert plants like Opuntia, have no leaves — they are reduced to spines— and the photosynthetic function is taken over by the ﬂattened stems. 2019-2020",1
1196,1126,"BIOLOGY the twentieth century, forests covered about 30 per cent of the land of India. By the end of the century, it shrunk to 2 1.54 per cent, whereas the National Forest Policy (1988) of India has recommended 33 per cent forest cover for the plains and 67 per cent for the hills. How does deforestation occur? A number of human activities contribute to it. One of the major reasons is the conversion of forest to agricultural land so as to feed the growing human population. Trees are axed for timber, ﬁrewood, cattle ranching and for several other purposes. Slash and burn agriculture, commonly called as Jhum cultivation in the north-eastern states of India, has also contributed to deforestation. In slash and burn agriculture, the farmers cut down the trees of the forest and burn the plant remains. The ash is used as a fertiliser and the land is then used for farming or cattle grazing. After cultivation, the area is left for several years so as to allow its recovery. The farmers then move on to other areas and repeat this process. In earlier days, when J hum cultivation was in prevalence, enough time-gap was given so that the land recovered from the effect of cultivation. With increasing population, and repeated cultivation, this recovery phase is done away with, resulting in deforestation. What are the consequences of deforestation? One of the major effects is enhanced carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere because trees that could hold a lot of carbon in their biomass are lost with deforestation. Deforestation also causes loss of biodiversity due to habitat destruction, disturbs hydrologic cycle, causes soil erosion, and may lead to desertiﬁcation in extreme cases. Reforestation is the process of restoring a forest that once existed but was removed at some point of time in the past. Reforestation may occur naturally in a deforested area. However, we can speed it up by planting trees with due consideration to biodiversity that earlier existed in that area. 16.9. 1 Case Study of People’s Participation in Conservation of Forests People’s participation has a long history in India. In 1731, the king of Jodhpur in Rajasthan asked one of his ministers to arrange wood for constructing a new palace. The minister and workers went to a forest near a village, inhabited by Bishnois, to cut down trees. The Bishnoi community is known for its peaceful co-existence with nature. The effort to cut down trees by the kings was thwarted by the Bishnois. A Bishnoi woman Amrita Devi showed exemplary courage by hugging a tree and daring king’s men to cut her ﬁrst before cutting the tree. The tree mattered much more to her than her own life. Sadly, the king’s men did not heed to her pleas, and cut down the tree along with Amrita Devi. Her three daughters and hundreds of other Bishnois followed her, and thus lost their lives saving trees.

Agriculture accounts for approximately 33 per cent of India’s GDP and employs nearly 62 per cent of the population. After India’s independence, one of the main challenges facing the country was that of producing enough food for the increasing population. As only limited land is ﬁt for cultivation, India has to strive to increase yields per unit area from em'sting farm land.

1199,1263,"184 Plasmodesmata Epidermis BIOLOGY The bulk movement of substances through the conducting or vascular tissues of plants is called translocation. Do you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves of higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants have highly specialised vascular tissues — xylem and phloem. Xylem is associated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic nitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The phloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly from the leaves to other parts of the plants. 1 1.3. 1 How do Plants Absorb Water? We know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants; obviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves. The responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more speciﬁcally the function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the roots. Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal cells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion. Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root layers by two distinct pathways: ' apoplast pathway ' symplast pathway The apoplast is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous throughout the plant, except at the casparian strips of the endodermis in the roots (Figure 1 1.6). The apoplastic movement of water occurs exclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells. Movement through the apoplast does not involve crossing the cell Plasma membrane ’ .

All we have to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the ﬂux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total ﬂux ¢ through a surface S is ¢:>:E-As (1.12) The approximation sign is put because the electric ﬁeld E is taken to be constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact only when you take the limit AS —> O and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written as an integral. 1. 1 1 ELECTRIC DIPOLE An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and —q, separated by a distance 2a. The line connecting the two charges defines a direction in space. By convention, the direction from —q to q is said to be the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of —q and q is called the centre of the dipole. The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and —q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when added, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than the separation of the two charges forming a dipole (r >> 2a), the fields due to q and —q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1 / r2 (the dependence on r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are borne out by the explicit calculation as follows: 1.1 1.1 The ﬁeld of an electric dipole The electric field of the pair of charges {—q and q) at any point in space can be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle. The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane of the dipole, i.e., on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre. The electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric ﬁelds E _q due to the charge —q and Eq due to the charge q, by the parallelogram law of vectors. (i) For points on the axis Let the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side of the charge q, as shown in Fig. 1.20(a).

Hence, it can be said that ﬂowering in certain plants depends not only on a combination of light and dark exposures but also their relative durations. This response of plants to periods of day/ night is termed photoperiodism. It is also interesting to note that while shoot apices modify themselves into ﬂowering apices prior to ﬂowering, they (i.e., shoot apices of plants) by themselves cannot percieve photoperiods. The site of perception of light/ dark duration are the leaves. It has been hypothesised that there is a hormonal substance(s) that is responsible for ﬂowering. This hormonal substance migrates from leaves to shoot apices for inducing ﬂowering only when the plants are exposed to the necessary inductive photoperiod. l 5.6 VERNALISATION There are plants for which ﬂowering is either quantitatively or qualitatively dependent on exposure to low temperature. This phenomenon is termed vernalisation. It prevents precocious reproductive development late in the growing season, and enables the plant to have sufficient time to reach maturity. Vernalisation refers specially to the promotion of ﬂowering by a period of low temperature. Some important food plants, wheat, barley, rye have two kinds of varieties: winter and spring varieties. The ‘spring’ variety are normally planted in the spring and come to ﬂower and produce grain before the end of the growing season. Winter varieties, however, if planted in spring would normally fail to ﬂower or produce mature grain within a span of a ﬂowering season. Hence, they are planted in autumn. They germinate, and over winter come out as small seedlings, resume growth in the spring, and are harvested usually around mid-summer. Another example of vernalisation is seen in biennial plants. Biennials are monocarpic plants that normally ﬂower and die in the second season. Sugarbeet, cabbages, carrots are some of the common biennials. Subjecting the growing of a biennial plant to a cold treatment stimulates a subsequent photoperiodic ﬂowering response. 15.7 SEED DORMANCY There are certain seeds which fail to germinate even when external conditions are favourable. Such seeds are understood to be undergoing a period of dormancy which is controlled not by external environment but are under endogenous control or conditions within the seed itself.

1202,261,"i Physics 6.8 EDDY CURRENTS So far we have studied the electric currents induced in well deﬁned paths in conductors like circular loops. Even when bulk pieces of conductors are subjected to changing magnetic ﬂux, induced currents are produced in them. However, their ﬂow patterns resemble swirling eddies in water. This effect was discovered by physicist Foucault (18 19- 1868) and these currents are called eddy currents. Consider the apparatus shown in Fig. 6. l 3. A copper plate is allowed to swing like a simple pendulum between the pole pieces of a strong magnet. It is found that the motion is damped and in a little while the plate comes to a halt in the magnetic field. We can explain this phenomenon on the basis of electromagnetic induction. Magnetic ﬂux associated with the plate keeps on changing as the plate moves in and out of the region between magnetic poles. The ﬂux change induces eddy currents in the plate. Directions of eddy currents are opposite when the plate swings into the region between the poles and when it swings out of the region. If rectangular slots are made in the copper plate as shown FIGURE 6. 13 Eddy currents are in Fig. 6.14, area available to the ﬂow of eddy currents is less. generated in the copper plate. while entering and leaving the region of magnetic field. FIGURE 6.14 Cutting slots in the copper plate reduces the effect of eddy currents. 218 Thus, the pendulum plate with holes or slots reduces electromagnetic damping and the plate swings more freely. Note that magnetic moments of the induced currents (which oppose the motion) depend upon the area enclosed by the currents (recall equation m = IA in Chapter 4). This fact is helpful in reducing eddy currents in the metallic cores of transformers, electric motors and other such devices in which a coil is to be wound over metallic core. Eddy currents are undesirable since they heat up the core and dissipate electrical energy in the form of heat. Eddy currents are minimised by using laminations of metal to make a metal core. The laminations are separated by an insulating material like lacquer. The plane of the laminations must be arranged parallel to the magnetic field, so that they cut across the eddy current paths. This arrangement reduces the strength of the eddy currents. Since the dissipation of electrical energy into heat depends on the square of the strength of electric current, heat loss is substantially reduced. Eddy currents are used to advantage in certain applications like: (i) Magnetic braking in trains: Strong electromagnets are situated above the rails in some electrically powered trains. When the electromagnets are activated, the eddy currents induced in the rails oppose the motion of the train. As there are no mechanical linkages, the braking effect is smooth. (ii) Electromagnetic damping: Certain galvanometers have a fixed core made of nonmagnetic metallic material. When the coil oscillates, the eddy currents generated in the core oppose the motion and bring the coil to rest quickly. 2019-20",0

An example of microbial biocontrol agents that can be introduced in order to control butterﬂy caterpillars is the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (often written as Bt). These are available in sachets as dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees, where these are eaten by the insect larvae. In the gut of the larvae, the toxin is released and the larvae get killed. The bacterial disease will kill the caterpillars, but leave other insects unharmed. Because of the development of methods of genetic engineering in the last decade or so, the scientists have introduced B. thuringiensis toxin genes into plants. Such plants are resistant to attack by insect pests. Bt-cotton is one such example, which is being cultivated in some states of our country. You will learn more about this in chapter 12. A biological control being developed for use in the treatment of plant disease is the fungus Trichoderma. Trichoderma species are free-living fungi that are very common in the root ecosystems. They are effective biocontrol agents of several plant pathogens. Baculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods. The majority of baculoviruses used as biological control agents are in the genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. These viruses are excellent candidates for species-speciﬁc, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications. They have been shown to have no negative impacts on plants, mammals, birds, ﬁsh or even on non-target insects. This is especially desirable when beneﬁcial insects are being conserved to aid in an overall integrated pest management (1PM) programme, or when an ecologically sensitive area is being treated. 10.6 MICROBES AS BIOFERTILISERS With our present day life styles environmental pollution is a major cause of concern.

1205,1090,"LOCOMOT ION AND MOVEMENT Some specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes in blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed by the streaming of protoplasm (as in Amoeba). Cytoskeletal elements like microﬁlaments are also involved in amoeboid movement. Ciliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which are lined by ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in the trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign substances inhaled alongwith the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through the female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement. Movement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular movement. The contractile property of muscles are effectively used for locomotion and other movements by human beings and majority of multicellular organisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated activity of muscular, skeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you will learn about the types of muscles, their structure, mechanism of their contraction and important aspects of the skeletal system. 20.2 MUSCLE You have studied in Chapter 8 that the cilia and ﬂagella are the outgrowths of the cell membrane. Flagellar movement helps in the swimming of spermatozoa, maintenance of water current in the canal system of sponges and in locomotion of Protozoans like Euglena. Muscle is a specialised tissue of mesodermal origin. About 40-50 per cent of the body weight of a human adult is contributed by muscles. They have special properties like excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscles have been classified using different criteria, namely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their activities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are identified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac. Skeletal muscles are closely associated with the skeletal components of the body. They have a striped appearance under the microscope and hence are called striated muscles. As their activities are under the voluntary control of the nervous system, they are known as voluntary muscles too. They are primarily involved in locomotory actions and changes of body postures. Visceral muscles are located in the inner walls of hollow visceral organs of the body like the alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. They do not exhibit any striation and are smooth in appearance. Hence, they are called smooth muscles (nonstriated muscle). Their activities are not under the voluntary control of the nervous system and are therefore known as involuntary muscles. ’Ihey assist, for example, in the transportation of food through the digestive tract and gametes through the genital tract.",1
1206,220,"244 PHYSICS 9.6.5 POISSON'S RATIO Careful observations with the Young’s modulus experiment (explained in section 9.6.2), show that there is also a slight reduction in the cross- section (or in the diameter) of the wire. The strain perpendicular to the applied force is called lateral strain. Simon Poisson pointed out that within the elastic limit, lateral strain is directly proportional to the longitudinal strain. The ratio of the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain in a stretched wire is called Poisson’s ratio. If the original diameter of the wire is d and the contraction of the diameter under stress is Ad, the lateral strain is Ad/d. If the original length of the wire is L and the elongation under stress is AL, the longitudinal strain is AL/ L. Poisson’s ratio is then (Ad/ d) / (AL/ L) or (Ad/AL) X (L/d). Poisson’s ratio is a ratio of two strains; it is a pure number and has no dimensions or units. Its value depends only on the nature of material. For steels the value is between 0.28 and 0.30, and for aluminium alloys it is about 0.33. 9.6.6 Elastic Potential Energy in a Stretched Wire When a wire is put under a tensile stress, work is done against the inter-atomic forces. This work is stored in the wire in the form of elastic potential energy. When a wire of original length L and area of cross-section A is subjected to a deforming force F along the length of the wire, let the length of the wire be elongated by I. Then from Eq. (9.8), we have F= YA X (l/L). Here Yis the Young’s modulus of the material of the wire. Now for a further elongation of infinitesimal small length dl, work done dWis F X dl or YAldl/ L.

All engineering designs require precise knowledge of the elastic behaviour of materials. For example while designing a building, the structural design of the columns, beams and supports require knowledge of strength of materials used. Have you ever thought why the beams used in construction of bridges, as supports etc. have a cross-section of the type 1? Why does a heap of sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape? Answers to these questions can be obtained from the study of structural engineering which is based on concepts developed here. Cranes used for lifting and moving heavy loads from one place to another have a thick metal rope to which the load is attached. The rope is pulled up using pulleys and motors. Suppose we want to make a crane, which has a lifting capacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1 metric ton = 1000 kg). How thick should the steel rope be? We obviously want that the load does not deform the rope permanently. Therefore, the extension should not exceed the elastic limit. From Table 9.1, we find that mild steel has a yield strength (0y) of about 300 x 106 N m‘2. Thus, the area of cross-section (A) of the rope should at least be A2 W/oy = Mg/oy (9.16) = (104 kgx 9.8 m s‘2)/(300 x 106 N m'2) = 3.3 x 10‘4 m2 corresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for a rope of circular cross-section. Generally a large margin of safety (of about a factor of ten in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of radius about 3 cm is recommended. A single wire of this radius would practically be a rigid rod. So the ropes are always made of a number of thin wires braided together,",0

(ii) Each photon has energy E (= hv) and momentum p (= h v/c), and speed c, the speed of light. (iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency v, or wavelength A, have the same energy E (=hv = hc/ﬂ.) and momentum p (= hv/c= h/l), whatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having the same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of radiation. (iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deﬂected by electric and magnetic ﬁelds. (v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the total energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number of photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be absorbed or a new photon may be created. Example 11.1 Monochromatic light of frequency 6.0 ><1014 Hz is produced by a laser. The power emitted is 2.0 ><10‘3 W. (a) What is the energy of a photon in the light beam? (b) How many photons per second, on an average, are emitted by the source? Solution (a) Each photon has an energy E = h v = (6.63 ><10‘34 J s) (6.0 x1014 Hz) = 3.98 x 10—ng (b) If N is the number of photons emitted by the source per second, the power P transmitted in the beam equals N times the energy per photon E, so that P = N E. Then _ P _ 2.0x10'3W N _ _— E 3.98x10‘19J = 5.0 ><1015 photons per second. Example 11.2 The work function of caesium is 2.14 eV. Find (a) the threshold frequency for caesium, and (b) the wavelength of the incident light if the photocurrent is brought to zero by a stopping potential of 0.60 V.

1213,1340,"282 BIOLOGY 18.2 LYMPH (TISSUE FLUID) As the blood passes through the capillaries in tissues, some water along with many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces between the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the formed elements in the blood vessels. This ﬂuid released out is called the interstitial ﬂuid or tissue ﬂuid. It has the same mineral distribution as that in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and the cells always occur through this ﬂuid. An elaborate network of vessels called the lymphatic system collects this ﬂuid and drains it back to the major veins. The ﬂuid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph. Lymph is a colourless ﬂuid containing specialised lymphocytes which are responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an important carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through lymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi. 18.3 CIRCULATORY PATHWAYS The circulatory patterns are of two types — open or closed. Open circulatory system is present in arthropods and molluscs in which blood pumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or body cavities called sinuses. Annelids and chordates have a closed circulatory system in which the blood pumped by the heart is always circulated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is considered to be more advantageous as the ﬂow of ﬂuid can be more precisely regulated. All vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart. Fishes have a 2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle. Amphibians and the reptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle, whereas crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a 4—chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. In ﬁshes the heart pumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills and supplied to the body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart (single circulation). In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the gills / lungs / skin and the right atrium gets the deoxygenated blood from other body parts. However, they get mixed up in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double circulation). In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood received by the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of the same sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two separate circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these animals have double circulation. Let us study the human circulatory system.",1
1214,10,"68 i Physics the situation in this case is more involved — the movement of the charge carriers is affected both by the external electric ﬁeld as also by the so-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion to metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding electrostatics of conductors. 1. Inside a conductor, electrostatic ﬁeld is zero Consider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external electrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside or on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere inside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a conductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not zero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the static situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the electric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a conductor. 2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field must be normal to the surface at every point If E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero component along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor would then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore, E should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the surface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every point. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero even at the surface.) See result 5. 3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in the static situation A neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges in every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged, the excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation. This follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element 0 inside a conductor. On the closed surface S bounding the volume element 0, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric ﬂux through S is zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But the surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume U can be made vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point inside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface. 4. Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume of the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on its surface This follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor and has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in moving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That is, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on the surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged, 2019-20",0

She applies a force of 100 N over a distance of 10 m. Thereafter. she gets progressively tired and her applied force reduces linearly with distance to 50 N. The total distance through which the trunk has been moved is 20 m. Plot the force applied by the woman and the frictional force, which is 50 N versus displacement. Calculate the work done by the two forces over 20 m. Fig. 6.4 Plot of the force Fapplied by the woman and the opposing frictional force f versus displacement. The plot of the applied force is shown in Fig. 6.4. At x = 20 m, F = 50 N (i 0). We are given that the frictional force f is If I = 50 N. It opposes motion and acts in a direction opposite to F.

We confine ourselves to one dimension. The time rate of change of kinetic energy is dK (1(1 2) —=— —mv dt dt 2 dv =m—v dt 2F u (from Newton’s Second Law) Thus dK = Fdx Integrating from the initial position (xi) to final position ( xf), we have Kf Xf j dK = dex Ki xi where, K. and K J, are the initial and final kinetic energies corresponding to xi and x f.

Some organisms breed only once in their lifetime (Paciﬁc salmon ﬁsh, bamboo) while others breed many times during their lifetime (most birds and mammals). Some produce a large number of small-sized offspring (Oysters, pelagic ﬁshes) while others produce a small number of large-sized offspring (birds, mammals). So, which is desirable for maximising ﬁtness? Ecologists suggest that life history traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints imposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which they live. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an important area of research being conducted by ecologists. 13.2.4 Population Interactions Can you think of any natural habitat on earth that is inhabited just by a single species? There is no such habitat and such a situation is even inconceivable. For any species, the minimal requirement is one more species on which it can feed. Even a plant species, which makes its own food, cannot suivive alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the organic matter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption. And then, how will the plant manage pollination without an animal agent? It is obvious that in nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot live in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological community. Even in minimal communities, many interactive linkages exist, although all may not be readily apparent. Interspeciﬁc interactions arise from the interaction of populations of two different species. They could be beneﬁcial, detrimental or neutral (neither harm nor beneﬁt) to one of the species or both. Assigning a ‘+’ sign for beneﬁcial interaction, ‘-’ sign for detrimental and O for neutral interaction, let us look at all the possible outcomes of interspecific interactions (Table 1 3. 1) .

(iii) A very heavy nucleus, say A = 240, has lower binding energy per nucleon compared to that of a nucleus with A = 120. Thus if a nucleus A = 240 breaks into two A = 120 nuclei, nucleons get more tightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process. It has very important implications for energy production through ﬁssion, to be discussed later in Section 13.7.1. (iv) Consider two very light nuclei (Ag 10) joining to form a heavier nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei is more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei. This means that the ﬁnal system is more tightly bound than the initial system. Again energy would be released in such a process of fusion. This is the energy source of sun, to be discussed later in Section 13.7.3. 13.5 NUCLEAR FORCE The force that determines the motion of atomic electrons is the familiar Coulomb force. In Section 13.4, we have seen that for average mass nuclei the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 8 MeV, which is much larger than the binding energy in atoms. Therefore, to bind a nucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally different kind. It must be strong enough to overcome the repulsion between the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and neutrons into the tiny nuclear volume. We have already seen that the constancy of binding energy per nucleon can be understood in terms of its short-range. Many features of the nuclear binding force are summarised below. These are obtained from avariety of experiments carried out during 1930 to 1950. (i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force acting between charges or the gravitational forces between masses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over the Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the nucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is Potential energy (MeV) much stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational force is much weaker than even Coulomb force. (ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to zero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This leads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized 2 3 r (fm) FIGURE 13.2 Potential energy of a pair of nucleons as a function of their separation.

The Strongly r€THIS“?- potential energy is a minimum at a distance r0 of about 0.8 fm.

This kind of process can generate through fusion higher and higher mass number elements. But elements more massive than those near the peak of the binding energy curve in Fig. 13.1 cannot be so produced. The age of the sun is about 5X 109 y and it is estimated that there is enough hydrogen in the sun to keep it going for another 5 billion years. After that, the hydrogen burning will stop and the sun will begin to cool and will start to collapse under gravity, which will raise the core temperature. The outer envelope of the sun will expand, turning it into the so called red giant. In a single uranium fission about 0.9X235 MeV (z200 MeV) of energy is liberated. If each nucleus of about 50 kg of 235U undergoes fission the amount of energy involved is about 4 X 1015J. This energy is equivalent to about 20,000 tons of TNT, enough for a superexplosion. Uncontrolled release of large nuclear energy is called an atomic explosion. On August 6, 1945 an atomic device was used in warfare for the ﬁrst time. The US dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. The explosion was equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT. Instantly the radioactive products devastated 10 sq km of the city which had 3,43,000 inhabitants. Of this number 66,000 were killed and 69,000 were injured; more than 67% of the city’s structures were destroyed. High temperature conditions for fusion reactions can be created by exploding a fission bomb. Super-explosions equivalent to 1 0 megatons of explosive power of TNT were tested in 1954. Such bombs which involve fusion of isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium are called hydrogen bombs. It is estimated that a nuclear arsenal sufﬁcient to destroy every form of life on this planet several times over is in position to be triggered by the press of a button. Such a nuclear holocaust will not only destroy the life that exists now but its radioactive fallout will make this planet unﬁt for life for all times. Scenarios based on theoretical calculations predict a long nuclear winter, as the radioactive waste will hang like a cloud in the earth’s atmosphere and will absorb the sun’s radiation. 13.7.4 Controlled thermonuclear fusion The natural thermonuclear fusion process in a star is replicated in a thermonuclear fusion device. In controlled fusion reactors, the aim is to generate steady power by heating the nuclear fuel to a temperature in the range of 108 K. At these temperatures, the fuel is a mixture of positive ions and electrons (plasma). The challenge is to confine this plasma, since no container can stand such a high temperature. Several countries around the world including India are developing techniques in this connection. If successful, fusion reactors will hopefully supply almost unlimited power to humanity. 2019-20 457",0

When we grind a tissue, we are disrupting the cell structure. Cell membrane and other membranes are broken into pieces, and form vesicles which are not water soluble. Therefore, these membrane fragments in the form of vesicles get separated along with the acid insoluble pool and hence in the macromolecular fraction. Lipids are not strictly macromolecules. The acid soluble pool represents roughly the cytoplasmic composition. The macromolecules from cytoplasm and organelles become the acid insoluble fraction. Together they represent the entire chemical composition of living tissues or organisms. In summary if we represent the chemical composition of living tissue from abundance point of view and arrange them class-wise, we observe that water is the most abundant chemical in living organisms (Table 9.4). 9.4 PROTEINS Proteins are polypeptides. They are linear chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in Figure 9.3. Each protein is a polymer of amino acids.

1223,158,"Electromagnetic Induction MIGRATION OF BIRDS The migratory pattern of birds is one of the mysteries in the field of biology, and indeed all of science. For example, every winter birds from Siberia ﬂy unerringly to water spots in the Indian subcontinent. There has been a suggestion that electromagnetic induction may provide a clue to these migratory patterns. The earth’s magnetic field has existed throughout evolutionary history. It would be of great benefit to migratory birds to use this field to determine the direction. As far as we know birds contain no ferromagnetic material. So electromagnetic induction seems to be the only reasonable mechanism to determine direction. Consider the optimal case where the magnetic field B, the velocity of the bird v, and two relevant points of its anatomy separated by a distance I, all three are mutually perpendicular. From the formula for motional emf, Eq. (6.5), 8=Blv Taking B = 4 X 10-5T, 1: 2 cm wide, and v = 10 m/s, we obtain 8 =4X 10‘5X2X lO‘ZX 10V=8X IO‘BV =8uV This extremely small potential difference suggests that our hypothesis is of doubtful validity. Certain kinds of fish are able to detect small potential differences. However, in these fish, special cells have been identified which detect small voltage differences. In birds no such cells have been identified. Thus, the migration patterns of birds continues to remain a mystery. SUMMARY 1. The magnetic ﬂux through a surface of areaA placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B is defined as, (DB = B.A= BA cos 6 where 9 is the angle between B and A. 2. Faraday’s laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of N turns is directly related to the rate of change of ﬂux through it, E = —N % dt Here 473 is the ﬂux linked with one turn of the coil. If the circuit is closed, a current I = 8 / R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the circuit. 3. Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic ﬂux that produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law indicates this fact. 4. When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic field B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the induced emf [called motional emf) across its ends is £=Blv 5. Changing magnetic fields can set up current loops in nearby metal [any conductor] bodies. They dissipate electrical energy as heat. Such currents are eddy currents. 6. Inductance is the ratio of the ﬂux—linkage to current. It is equal to Ndﬁ/I. 227 2019-20",0
1224,285,"32 PHYSICS quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are the equations, which represent the dimensions of a physical quantity in terms of the base quantities. For example, the dimensional equations of volume [V], speed [1)], force [F] and mass density [p] may be expressed as [V] = [M0 L310] [v1 = [M0 LTI] [F] = [M LTZ] [p1 = [M L-3 T0] The dimensional equation can be obtained from the equation representing the relations between the physical quantities. The dimensional formulae of a large number and wide variety of physical quantities, derived from the equations representing the relationships among other physical quantities and expressed in terms of base quantities are given in Appendix 9 for your guidance and ready reference. 2.10 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS APPLICATIONS The recognition of concepts of dimensions, which guide the description of physical behaviour is of basic importance as only those physical quantities can be added or subtracted which have the same dimensions. A thorough understanding of dimensional analysis helps us in deducing certain relations among different physical quantities and checking the derivation, accuracy and dimensional consistency or homogeneity of various mathematical expressions. When magnitudes of two or more physical quantities are multiplied, their units should be treated in the same manner as ordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel identical units in the numerator and denominator. The same is true for dimensions of a physical quantity. Similarly, physical quantities represented by symbols on both sides of a mathematical equation must have the same dimensions. 2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional Consistency of Equations The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions. In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted 2019-20 from the thermodynamic temperature. This simple principle called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of equation, when simplified, must be of length/ time, or [L T1]. Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation. However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless. A pure number, ratio of similar physical quantities, such as angle as the ratio (length/length), refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in vacuum / speed of light in medium) etc., has no dimensions. Now we can test the dimensional consistency or homogeneity of the equation x=x0 +v0 t+(l/2)at2 for the distance x travelled by a particle or body in time twhich starts from the position x0 with an initial velocity Do at time t= O and has uniform acceleration a along the direction of motion.

It may be noted that a test of consistency of dimensions tells us no more and no less than a",0
1225,640,"Electromagnetic Waves We brieﬂy describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in order of decreasing wavelengths. 8.4. 1 Radio waves Radio waves are produced by the accelerated motion of charges in conducting wires. They are used in radio and television communication systems. They are generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHZ. The AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1 710 kHz. Higher frequencies upto 54 MHZ are used for short wave bands. TV waves range from 54 MHZ to 890 MHZ. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band extends from 88 MHZ to 108 MHZ. Cellular phones use radio waves to transmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. How these waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15. 8.4.2 Microwaves Microwaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in the gigahertZ (GHZ) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (called klystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths, they are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radar also provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis- serves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic application of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves is selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that energy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of the molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water. MICROWAVE OVEN The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation contains a part known as microwaves. These waves have frequency and energy smaller than visible light and wavelength larger than it. What is the principle of a microwave oven and how does it work? Our objective is to cook food or warm it up. All food items such as fruit, vegetables, meat, cereals, etc. , contain water as a constituent. Now, what does it mean when we say that a certain object has become warmer? When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of the random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or rotate with higher energies. The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about 2.45 gigahertZ (GHZ). If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules absorb this radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. These molecules share this energy with neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food. One should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because of the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. Metals may also melt from heating. The porcelain container remains unaffected and cool, because its large molecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies, and thus cannot absorb microwaves. Hence, they do not get heated up. Thus, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of appropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. This way energy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. In the conventional heating method, the vessel on the burner gets heated first, and then the food inside gets heated because of transfer of energy from the vessel. In the microwave oven, on the other hand, energy is directly delivered to water molecules which is shared by the entire food. Microwave 281 2019-20",0

When an identical but uncharged sphere C touches A, the charges redistribute on A and C and, by symmetry, each sphere carries a charge q/2. Similarly, after D touches B, the redistributed charge on each is q / 2.

How to calculate the force on a charge where there are not one but several charges around? Consider a system of n stationary charges q1, q2, q3, qn in vacuum. What is the force on q1 due to q2, q3, qn? Coulomb’s law is not enough to answer this question. Recall that forces of mechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of addition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin? Experimentally, it is verified that force on any charge due to a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces on that charge due to the other charges, taken one at a time. The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of other charges. This is termed as the principle of superposition. To better understand the concept, consider a system of three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in Fig. 1.8(a). The force on one charge, say ql, due to two other charges q2, q3 can therefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the forces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1 due to q2 is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq.

Such buds are present in the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a ﬂower. The meristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as intercalary meristem. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the grazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are primary meristems because they appear early in life of a plant and contribute to the formation of the primary plant body.

They are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium, interfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral meristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues.

1228,204,"Alternating Current with the source frequency and the attractive force would average to zero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property that is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating is such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of alternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same average heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce under the same conditions. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one should take care of their phases properly. For example, if VR and VC are voltages across R and C. respectively in an RC circuit, then the total voltage across RC combination is VRC =‘IVE +VC2j and not VR + VC since VC is 7r/2 out of phase of VR. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by vectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding magnitudes and directions. The “rotating vectors” that represent harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know as the law of vector addition. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure inductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy in an ac circuit is the resistive element. In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when XL = XC or I (00 = —. For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C x/E elements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C) elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence, no resonance is possible. The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the circuit is to expending the maximum power. .In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are reversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical energy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the input and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply transform energy from one form to another. . A transformer (step—up) changes a low—voltage into a high—voltage. This does not violate the law of conservation of energy.

It needs to be mentioned here that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs. What are the major features of embryonic development at various months of pregnancy? The human pregnancy lasts 9 months. Do you know for how many months pregnancy last in dogs, elephants, cats? Find out. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s heart is formed. The ﬁrst sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening to the heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. By the end of the second month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits. By the end of 12 weeks (ﬁrst trimester), most of the major organ systems are formed, for example, the limbs and external genital organs are well- developed. The ﬁrst movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on the head are usually observed during the ﬁfth month. By the end of about 24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with ﬁne hair, eye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed. By the end of nine months of pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery. 3.7 PARTURITION AND LACTATION The average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months which is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsion/ delivery of the foetus. This process of delivery of the foetus (childbirth) is called parturition. Parturition is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism. The signals for parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta which induce mild uterine contractions called foetal ejection reﬂex. This triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in turn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reﬂex between the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in stronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby out of the uterus through the birth canal — parturition. Soon after the infant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. What do you think the doctors inject to induce delivery? The mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during pregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by the process called lactation. This helps the mother in feeding the new- born. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called colostrum which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to develop resistance for the new-born babies. Breast-feeding during the initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up a healthy baby. 2019-2020",1

Though you will learn in detail in mathematics about derivatives, we shall introduce this concept in brief in this Appendix so as to facilitate its use in describing physical quantities involved in motion. Suppose we have a quantity y whose value depends upon a single van'able x, and is expressed by an equation defining y as some specific function of x. This is represented as: y=fm (D This relationship can be visualised by drawing a graph of function y = f (x) regarding y and x as Cartesian coordinates, as shown in Fig. 3.30 (a).

The slope of the line joining P and Q is given by: _Ay_(y+Ay)—y tan _E——AX (2) Suppose now that the point Q moves along the curve towards P. In this process, Ay and Ax decrease and approach zero; though their ratio ﬂ will not necessarily vanish. What happens Ax to the line PQ as Ay—> O, Axe 0. You can see that this line becomes a tangent to the curve at point P as shown in Fig. 3.30(b). This means that tan 6 approaches the slope of the tangent at P, denoted by m: Ay (y + Ay) — y m=ggm=m— (3) The limit of the ratio Ay/Ax as Ax approaches zero is called the derivative of y with respect to x and is written as dy/dx. It represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f (x) at the point (x, y).

The function f (t) is then periodic and its period, T, is given by 27: = — ( 1 4 . 3b) 60 Thus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T, f (t) =f(t+T ) The same result is obviously correct if we consider a sine function, f (t) = A sin wt. Further, a linear combination of sine and cosine functions like, f(t) = Asin wt+Bcos cot (14.3c) is also a periodic function with the same period T. Taking, A=Dcos q) and B=Dsin¢ Eq.

Example 14.2 Which of the following functions of time represent (a) periodic and (b) non—periodic motion? Give the period for each case of periodic motion (a) is any positive constant].

It can be noted that each term represents a periodic function with a different angular frequency. Since period is the least interval of time after which a function repeats its value, sin cot has a period To: 27c/a); cos 2 cat has a period Tc/a) =T0/ 2; and sin 4 cat has a period 27c/4a) = TO/ 4. The period of the first term is a multiple of the periods of the last two terms. Therefore, the smallest interval of time after which the sum of the three terms repeats is To, and thus, the sum is a periodic function with a period 27c/a). (iii) The function e'm‘ is not periodic, it decreases monotonically with increasing time and tends to zero as t—> co and thus, never repeats its value. (iv) The function log(a)t) increases monotonically with time t. It, therefore, never repeats its value and is a non- pen‘odic function. It may be noted that as t—> 00, log(a)t) diverges to 00.

1234,1297,"BIOLOGY 6.9 HUMAN GENOME PROJECT In the preceding sections you have learnt that it is the sequence of bases in DNA that determines the genetic information of a given organism. In other words, genetic make-up of an organism or an individual lies in the DNA sequences. If two individuals differ, then their DNA sequences should also be different, at least at some places. These assumptions led to the quest of ﬁnding out the complete DNA sequence of human genome. With the establishment of genetic engineering techniques where it was possible to isolate and clone any piece of DNA and availability of simple and fast techniques for determining DNA sequences, a very ambitious project of sequencing human genome was launched in the year 1990. Human Genome Project (HGP) was called a mega project. You can imagine the magnitude and the requirements for the project if we simply deﬁne the aims of the project as follows: Human genome is said to have approm’mately 3 X 109 bp, and if the cost of sequencing required is US $ 3 per bp (the estimated cost in the beginning), the total estimated cost of the project would be approximately 9 billion US dollars. Further, if the obtained sequences were to be stored in typed form in books, and if each page of the book contained 1000 letters and each book contained 1000 pages, then 3300 such books would be required to store the information of DNA sequence from a single human cell. The enormous amount of data expected to be generated also necessitated the use of high speed computational devices for data storage and retrieval, and analysis. HGP was closely associated with the rapid development of a new area in biology called Bioinformatics. Goals of HGP Some of the important goals of HGP were as follows: (i) Identify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in human DNA; (ii) Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA; (iiii) Store this information in databases; (iv) Improve tools for data analysis; (v) Transfer related technologies to other sectors, such as industries; (vi) Address the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) that may arise from the project. The Human Genome Project was a 13-year project coordinated by the US. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. During the early years of the HGP, the Wellcome Trust (U.K.) became a major partner; additional contributions came from Japan, France, Germany, China and others. The project was completed in 2003.

1235,1223,"BIOLOGY You may have realised that normally, unless one cuts the vector and the source DNA with the same restriction enzyme, the recombinant vector molecule cannot be created. Separation and isolation of DNA fragments : The cutting of DNA by restriction endonucleases results in the fragments of DNA. These fragments can be separated by a technique known as gel electrophoresis. Since DNA fragments are negatively charged molecules they can be separated by forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric ﬁeld through a medium / matrix. Nowadays the most commonly used matrix is agarose which is a natural polymer extracted from sea weeds. The DNA fragments separate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel. Hence, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it moves. Look at the Figure 1 1.3 and guess at which end of the gel the sample was loaded. The separated DNA fragments can be visualised only after staining the DNA Wells with a compound known as ethidium i fbghvdAs—\ bromide followed by exposure to UV Largest Smallest radiation [you cannot see pure DNA DI U III] /I// U III/ / U IIII fragments in the visible light and without staining). You can see bright orange coloured bands of DNA in a ethidium bromide stained gel exposed to UV light (Figure 1 1.3). The separated bands of DNA are cut out Figure 11.3 A typical agarose gel from the agarose gel and extracted electrophoresis showing from the gel piece. This step is known migration 0f undigeSted as elution. The DNA fragments (lane 1) and digested set of DNA fragments (lane 2 to 4) purified in this way are used in constructing recombinant DNA by joining them with cloning vectors. 1 1.2.2 Cloning Vectors You know that plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate within bacterial cells independent of the control of chromosomal DNA. Bacteriophages because of their high number per cell, have very high copy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cells. Some plasmids may have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have 1 5- 100 copies per cell. Their numbers can go even higher. If we are able to link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can multiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or bacteriophage. Vectors used at present, are engineered in such a way that they help easy linking of foreign DNA and selection of recombinants from non-recombinants. 2019-2020",1

Further, the magnitude and the direction of the dipole ﬁeld depends not only on the distance r but also on the angle between the position vector 1' and the dipole moment p. We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2a approaches zero, the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product p = q X 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole. For a point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.2 l) are exact, true for any r. 1.1 1.2 Physical signiﬁcance of dipoles In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges* lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 and CH 4 are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric field.

(Note that this is not the angle actually subtended by the object at the eye, which is h/u.) What a single-lens simple magnifier achieves is that it allows the object to be brought closer to the eye than D. We will now find the magnification when the image is at infinity. In this case we will have to obtained the angular magnification. Suppose the object has a height h. The maximum angle it can subtend, and be clearly visible (without a lens), is when it is at the near point, i.e., a distance D. The angle subtended is then given by tan 60 = (E) z 9 (9.40) D 0 We now find the angle subtended at the eye by the image when the object is at u.

1242,899,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS are available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean. Among the red, green and brown algae that inhabit the sea, which is likely to be found in the deepest waters? Why? Soil: The nature and properties of soil in different places vary; it is dependent on the climate, the weathering process, whether soil is transported or sedimentary and how soil development occurred. Various characteristics of the soil such as soil composition, grain size and aggregation determine the percolation and water holding capacity of the soils. These characteristics along with parameters such as pH, mineral composition and topography determine to a large extent the vegetation in any area. This in turn dictates the type of animals that can be supported. Similarly, in the aquatic environment, the sediment-characteristics often determine the type of benthic animals that can thrive there. 13. 1.2 Responses to Abiotic Factors Having realised that the abiotic conditions of many habitats may vary drastically in time, we now ask—how do the organisms living in such habitats cope or manage with stressﬁil conditions? But before attempting to answer this question, we should perhaps ask ﬁrst why a highly variable external environment should bother organisms after all. One would expect that during the course of millions of years of their existence, many species would have evolved a relatively constant internal (within the body) environment that permits all biochemical reactions and physiological functions to proceed with maximal efﬁciency and thus, enhance the overall ‘ﬁtness’ of the species. This constancy, for example, could be in terms of optimal temperature and osmotic concentration of body ﬂuids. Ideally then, the organism should try to maintain the constancy of its internal environment (a process called homeostasis) despite varying external environmental conditions that tend to upset its homeostasis. Let us take an analogy to clarify this important concept. Suppose a person is able to perform his / her best when the temperature is 25°C and wishes to maintain it so, even when it is Partial regulators Internal level —> External level—> Figure 13.3 Diagrammatic representation of scorchingly hot or freezingly cold outside.

If one examines each requirement one by one, because of rule of base pairing and complementarity, both the nucleic acids DNA and RNA) have the ability to direct their duplications. The other molecules in the living system, such as proteins fail to fulﬁll ﬁrst criteria itself. The genetic material should be stable enough not to change with different stages of life cycle, age or with change in physiology of the organism. Stability as one of the properties of genetic material was very evident in Grifﬁth’s ‘transforming principle’ itself that heat, which killed the bacteria, at least did not destroy some of the properties of genetic material. This now can easily be explained in light of the DNA that the two strands being complementary if separated by heating come together, when appropriate conditions are provided. Further, 2'-OH group present at every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and easily degradable. RNA is also now known to be catalytic, hence reactive. Therefore, DNA chemically is less reactive and structurally more stable when compared to RNA. Therefore, among the two nucleic acids, the DNA is a better genetic material. In fact, the presence of thymine at the place of uracil also confers additional stability to DNA. (Detailed discussion about this requires understanding of the process of repair in DNA, and you will study these processes in higher classes.) Both DNA and RNA are able to mutate. In fact, RNA being unstable, mutate at a faster rate. Consequently, viruses having RNA genome and having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster. RNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins, hence can easily express the characters. DNA, however, is dependent on RNA for synthesis of proteins. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA. The above discussion indicate that both RNA and DNA can function as 2019—2020 103",1
1244,1606,"Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors 199 The trial balance when prepared on the basis of above balances will not tally. Its credit column total will amount to f 50,000 and debit column total to f 35,000. The trial balance would differ with ? 15,000. This difference will be temporarily put to suspense account and trial balance will be made to agree in the ledger. In the above case, difference in trial balance has arisen due to one sided error (omission of posting to Diwakar and sons’s account). In a real situation, there can be many other such one-sided errors which cause a difference in trial balance and thus result in opening of the suspense account. Till the all errors affecting agreement of trial balance are not located it is not possible to rectify them and tally the trial balance in such a situation, is shown in the Suspense account, make the total of debit and credit columns and proceed further with the accounting process. When the errors are located and the specific accounts and amounts involved are identified, the amounts are transferred from suspense account to the relevant accounts thereby closing the suspense account. Thus, suspense account is not placed in any particular category of accounts and is just a temporary phenomenon. While rectifying one-sided errors using suspense account, the following steps are taken: (i) Identify the account affected due to error. (ii) Ascertain the amount of excess debit / credit or short debit / credit in the affected account. (iii) If the error has resulted in excess debit or short credit in the affected account, credit the account with the amount of excess debit or short credit. (iv) If the error has resulted in excess credit or short debit in the affected account, debit the account with the amount of excess credit or short debit. (v) Complete the journal entry by debiting or crediting the suspense account as another account affected otherwise.

Applying second law to motion of the block (Fig. 5.12(b)), 3O — T = 3a Apply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig. 5.12(c)), T—J; = 20 a. Now fk =ukN, Here pk =0.04, N = 20x 10 = 200 N. Thus the equation for the motion of the trolley is T— 0.04X 200 = 20 a Or T— 8 = 20a. These equations give a = 2 m s*2 = 0.96 m s2 23 andT =27.1 N. 4 Rolling friction A body like a ring or a sphere rolling without slipping over a horizontal plane will suffer no friction, in principle. At every instant, there is just one point of contact between the body and the plane and this point has no motion relative to the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or static friction is zero and the body should continue to roll with constant velocity. We know, in practice, this will not happen and some resistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur, i.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force is needed. For the same weight, rolling friction is much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude) than static or sliding friction. This is the reason why discovery of the wheel has been a major milestone in human history. Rolling friction again has a complex origin, though somewhat different from that of static and sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces in contact get momentarily deformed a little, and this results in a finite area (not a point) of the body being in contact with the surface. The net effect is that the component of the contact force parallel to the surface opposes motion. We often regard friction as something undesirable. In many situations, like in a machine with different moving parts, friction does have a negative role. It opposes relative motion and thereby dissipates power in the form of heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing kinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to use ball bearings between two moving parts of a machine [Fig. 5.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction between ball bearings and the surfaces in contact is very small, power dissipation is reduced. A thin cushion of air maintained between solid surfaces in relative motion is another effective way of reducing friction (Fig. 5.13(a)). In many practical situations, however, friction is critically needed. Kinetic friction that dissipates power is nevertheless important for quickly stopping relative motion. It is made use of by brakes in machines and automobiles. Similarly, static friction is important in daily life. We are able to walk because of friction. It is impossible for a car to move on a very slippery road. On an ordinary road, the friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary external force to accelerate the car.

We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and — signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above- mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to add, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail. The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions. 4.2 SCALARS AND VECTORS In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are : the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided 2019-20",0

One plus is set off by the other minus, the net effect of these two errors is nil and so they do not affect the agreement of trial balance. 6.5 Searching of Errors If the trial balance does not tally, it is a clear indication that at least one error has occured. The error (or errors) needs to be located and corrected before preparing the ﬁnancial statements. If the trial balance does not tally, the accountant should take the following steps to detect and locate the errors : Recast the totals of debit and credit columns of the trial balance. Compare the account head / title and amount appearing in the trial balance, with that of the ledger to detect any difference in amount or omission of an account. Compare the trial balance of current year with that of the previous year to check additions and deletions of any accounts and also verify whether there is a large difference in amount, which is neither expected nor explained. Re-do and check the correctness of balances of individual accounts in the ledger. Re-check the correctness of the posting in accounts from the books of original entry. If the difference between the debit and credit columns is divisible by 2, there is a possibility that an amount equal to one-half of the difference may have been posted to the wrong side of another ledger account. For example, if the total of the debit column of the trial balance exceeds by ? 1,500, it is quite possible that a credit item of ?750 may have been wrongly posted in the ledger as a debit item. To locate such errors, the accountant should scan all the debit entries of an amount of ? 750. The difference may also indicate a complete omission of a posting. For example, the difference of ? 1,500 given above may be due to omissions of a posting of that amount on the credit side. Thus, the accountant should verify all the credit items with an amount of ? 1,500. If the difference is a multiple of 9 or divisible by 9, the mistake could be due to transposition of figures. For example, if a debit amount of ? 459 is posted as ? 954, the debit total in the trial balance will exceed the credit side by ? 495 (i.e. 954 — 459 = 495). This difference is divisible by 9. A mistake due to wrong placement of the decimal point may also be checked by this method. Thus, a difference in trial balance divisible by 9 helps in checking the errors for a transposed mistake. 2019-2020",3

The stomach, located in the upper left portion of the abdominal cavity, has four major parts — a cardiac portion into which the oesophagus opens, a fundic region, body (main central region) and a pyloric portion which opens into the ﬁrst part of small intestine (Figure 16.3). Small intestine is distinguishable into three regions, a ‘C’ shaped duodenum, a long coiled middle portion jejunum and a highly coiled ileum. The opening of the stomach into the duodenum is guarded by the pyloric sphincter. Ileum opens into the large intestine. It consists of caecum, colon and rectum. Caecum is a small blind sac which hosts some symbiotic micro-organisms. A narrow ﬁnger-like tubular projection, the vermiform appendix which is a vestigial organ, arises from the caecum. The caecum opens into the colon. The colon is divided into four parts — an ascending, a transverse, descending part and a sigmoid colon. The descending part opens into the rectum which opens out through the anus. The wall of alimentary canal from oesophagus to rectum possesses four layers (Figure 16.4) namely serosa, muscularis, sub-mucosa and mucosa. Serosa is the outermost layer and is made up of a thin mesothelium (epithelium of visceral organs) with some connective tissues. Muscularis is formed by smooth muscles usually arranged into an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. An oblique muscle layer may be present in some regions. The sub- mucosal layer is formed of loose connective tissues containing nerves, blood and lymph vessels. In duodenum, glands are also present in sub-mucosa. The innermost layer lining the lumen of the alimentary canal is the mucosa. This layer forms irregular folds (rugae) in the stomach and small ﬁnger-like foldings called villi in the small intestine (Figure 1 6.5).

E is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in space and is determined from the positions of the source charges. 1.8.2 Physical signiﬁcance of electric field You may wonder why the notion of electric ﬁeld has been introduced here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this intermediate quantity called the electric ﬁeld? For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing the system). Electric ﬁeld is a characteristic of the system of charges and is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine the ﬁeld. The term ﬁeld in physics generally refers to a quantity that is deﬁned at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric ﬁeld is a vector ﬁeld, since force is a vector quantity. The true physical signiﬁcance of the concept of electric ﬁeld, however, emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time- dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force between two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another is c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannot 2019-20",0
1252,389,"l Physics A SPECIAL CASE OF TOTAL TRANSMISSION When light is incident on an interface of two media, it is observed that some part of it gets reﬂected and some part gets transmitted. Consider a related question: Is it possible that under some conditions a monochromatic beam of light incident on a surface (which is normally reﬂective) gets completely transmitted with no reﬂection? To your surprise, the answer is yes. Screen Let us try a simple experiment and check what happens. Arrange a laser, a good polariser, a prism and screen as shown in the ﬁgure here. Let the light emitted by the laser source pass through the polariser and be incident on the surface of the prism at the Brewster’s angle of incidence iB. Now rotate the polariser carefully and you will observe that for a speciﬁc alignment of the polariser, the light incident on the prism is completely transmitted and no light is reﬂected from the surface of the prism. The reﬂected spot will completely vanish. ‘ 10.7.2 Polarisation by reﬂection Figure 10.23(b) shows light reﬂected from a transparent medium, say, water. As before, the dots and arrows indicate that both polarisations are present in the incident and refracted waves. We have drawn a situation in which the reﬂected wave travels at right angles to the refracted wave. The oscillating electrons in the water produce the reﬂected wave. These move in the two directions transverse to the radiation from wave in the medium, i.e., the refracted wave. The arrows are parallel to the direction of the reﬂected wave. Motion in this direction does not contribute to the reﬂected wave. As the ﬁgure shows, the reﬂected light is therefore linearly polarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure (represented by dots). This can be checked by looking at the reﬂected light through an analyser. The transmitted intensity will be zero when the axis of the analyser is in the plane of the figure, i.e., the plane of incidence. When unpolarised light is incident on the boundary between two transparent media, the reﬂected light is polarised with its electric vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence when the refracted and reﬂected rays make a right angle with each other. Thus we have seen that when reﬂected wave is perpendicular to the refracted wave, the reﬂected wave is a totally polarised wave. The angle of incidence in this case is called Brewster’s angle and is denoted by iB. We can see that iB is related to the refractive index of the denser medium. Since we have iB+r = at / 2, we get from Snell’s law _ sin iB sin iB 380 # sinr sin(7r/2—iB) 2019-20",0
1253,803,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS 1 1.4. 1 Transpiration and Photosynthesis — a Compromise Transpiration has more than one purpose; it ° creates transpiration pull for absorption and transport of plants ' supplies water for photosynthesis ° transports minerals from the soil to all parts of the plant ° cools leaf surfaces, sometimes 10 to 15 degrees, by evaporative cooling ' maintains the shape and structure of the plants by keeping cells turgid An actively photosynthesising plant has an insatiable need for water. Photosynthesis is limited by available water which can be swiftly depleted by transpiration. The humidity of rainforests is largely due to this vast cycling of water from root to leaf to atmosphere and back to the soil. The evolution of the C 4 photosynthetic system is probably one of the strategies for maximising the availability of CO2 while minimising water loss. C 4 plants are twice as efficient as C3 plants in terms of ﬁxing carbon dioxide (making sugar). However, a C 4 plant loses only half as much water as a C3 plant for the same amount of CO2 ﬁxed. 1 1.5 UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT 0F MINERAL NUTRIENTS Plants obtain their carbon and most of their oxygen from CO2 in the atmosphere. However, their remaining nutritional requirements are obtained from water and minerals in the soil. 1 1.5. 1 Uptake of Mineral Ions Unlike water, all minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors account for this: (i) minerals are present in the soil as charged particles (ions) which cannot move across cell membranes and (ii) the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals must enter the root by active absorption into the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy in the form of ATP. The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the water potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by osmosis. Some ions also move into the epidermal cells passively. Ions are absorbed from the soil by both passive and active transport. Speciﬁc proteins in the membranes of root hair cells actively pump ions from the soil into the cytoplasms of the epidermal cells. Like all cells, the endodermal cells have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma membrane; they let some solutes cross the membrane, but not others. Transport proteins of endodermal cells are control points, where a plant adjusts the quantity and types of solutes that reach the xylem Note that the root endodermis because of the layer of suberin has the ability to actively transport ions in one direction only. 189",1

Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume (p v2 / 2) and the potential energy per unit volume (pgy) remains a constant. P+ pu2/2 + pgy = constant The equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss ﬂuid motion in steady state. There is no ﬂuid which have zero viscosity, so the above statement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the kinetic energy to heat energy. Though shear strain in a ﬂuid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is applied to a ﬂuid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing with time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known as coefﬁcient of viscosity, 1} where symbols have their usual meaning and are defined in the text. Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with velocity v through a ﬂuid of viscosity is, F = — 6mav. Surface tension is a force per unit length [or surface energy per unit area) acting in the plane of interface between the liquid and the bounding surface. It is the extra energy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to the interior. POINTS TO PONDER 1. Pressure is a scalar quantity. The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area"" may give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The “force"" in the numerator of the definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is impressed. While describing ﬂuids as a concept. shift from particle and rigid body mechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point in the ﬂuid. One should not think of pressure of a ﬂuid as being exerted only on a solid like the walls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the ﬂuid. Pressure exists at all points in a ﬂuid. An element of a ﬂuid {such as the one shown in Fig. 10.2] is in equilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal. The expression for pressure P= Pu+ p gh holds true if ﬂuid is incompressible. Practically speaking it holds for liquids. which are largely incompressible and hence is a constant with height. The gauge pressure is the difference of the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure. P— P = P Many pressure—measuring devices measure the gauge pressure. These include the tyre pressure gauge and the blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer). A streamline is a map of ﬂuid ﬂow. In a steady ﬂow two streamlines do not intersect as it means that the ﬂuid particle will have two possible velocities at the point. Bernoulli’s principle does not hold in presence of viscous drag on the ﬂuid. The work done by this dissipative viscous force must be taken into account in this case. and P2 [Fig 10.9] will be lower than the value given by Eq. (10.12). As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient of viscosity. 1] falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of atoms and nincreases. Surface tension arises due to excess potential energy of the molecules on the surface in comparison to their potential energy in the interior. Such a surface energy is present at the interface separating two substances at least one of which is a ﬂuid. It is not the property of a single ﬂuid alone. 2019-20",0

Imagine a world where there is no electricity — no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and no personal computers. The pioneering experiments of Faraday and Henry have led directly to the development of modern day generators and transformers. Today’s civilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the discovery of electromagnetic induction. 6.2 THE EXPERIMENTS OF FARADAY AND HENRY The discovery and understanding of electromagnetic induction are based on a long series of experiments carried out by Faraday and Henry. We shall now describe some of these experiments. Went/went (ll Figure 6.1 shows a coil C1* connected to a galvanometer G. When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushed towards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deﬂects, indicating the presence of electric current in the coil. The deﬂection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion. The galvanometer does not show any deﬂection when the magnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled away from the coil, the galvanometer shows deﬂection in the opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the currents direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of the bar magnet is moved towards or away from the coil, the deﬂections in the galvanometer are opposite to that observed with the North-pole for similar movements. Further, the deﬂection (and hence current) is found to be larger when the magnet is pushed towards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead, when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C1 is moved towards or away from the magnet, the same effects are observed. It shows that it is the relative motion between the magnet and the coil that is responsible for generation (induction) of electric current in the coil.

If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the pollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube growth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed by its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue between pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical components of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in recent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen — and pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition, followed by acceptance or rejection. As mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain germinates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the germ pores (Figure 2.12a).

1260,1377,"BIOLOGY The genes in a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a set of functions. For example, if an enzyme called beta-galactosidase is synthesised by E. coli, it is used to catalyse the hydrolysis of a disaccharide, lactose into galactose and glucose; the bacteria use them as a source of energy. Hence, if the bacteria do not have lactose around them to be utilised for energy source, they would no longer require the synthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Therefore, in simple terms, it is the metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions that regulate the expression of genes. The development and differentiation of embryo into adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of expression of several sets of genes. In prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the predominant site for control of gene expression. In a transcription unit, the activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is in turn regulated by interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise start sites. These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators) and negatively (repressors). The accessibility of promoter regions of prokaryotic DNA is in many cases regulated by the interaction of proteins with sequences termed operators. The operator region is adjacent to the promoter elements in most operons and in most cases the sequences of the operator bind a repressor protein. Each operon has its specific operator and speciﬁc repressor. For example, lac operator is present only in the lac operon and it interacts speciﬁcally with lac repressor only. 6.8.1 The Lac operon The elucidation of the lac operon was also a result of a close association between a geneticist, Francois Jacob and a biochemist, J acque Monod. They were the first to elucidate a transcriptionally regulated system. In lac operon (here lac refers to lactose), a polycistronic structural gene is regulated by a common promoter and regulatory genes. Such arrangement is very common in bacteria and is referred to as operon. To name few such examples, lac operon, trp operon, ara operon, his operon, val operon, etc. The lac operon consists of one regulatory gene (the igene — here the term i does not refer to inducer, rather it is derived from the word inhibitor) and three structural genes (2, y, and a). The igene codes for the repressor of the lac operon. The z gene codes for beta-galactosidase (Ii-gal), which is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of the disaccharide, lactose into its monomeric units, galactose and glucose. The y gene codes for permease, which increases permeability of the cell to ﬁ-galactosides. The a gene encodes a transacetylase. Hence, all the three gene products in lac operon are required for metabolism of lactose. In most other operons as well, the genes present in the operon are needed together to function in the same or related metabolic pathway (Figure 6.14). 2019-2020",1

Suppose we are given that, on an average, the efficiency of utilization (i.e. conversion to electric energy) of thermal energy produced in a reactor was 25%.

Thus for the same quantity of matter, nuclear sources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source. Fission of 1 kg of uranium, for example, generates 1014 J of energy; compare it with burning of 1 kg of coal that gives 107 J. 13.7. 1 Fission New possibilities emerge when we go beyond natural radioactive decays and study nuclear reactions by bombarding nuclei with other nuclear particles such as proton, neutron, oc-particle, etc. A most important neutron-induced nuclear reaction is ﬁssion. An example of fission is when a uranium isotope 2325U bombarded with a neutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments 1 235 236 144 89 1 on+92U—> 92U—> 56Ba+36Kr+30n (13.26) The same reaction can produce other pairs of intermediate mass fragments gn+2§§U —> 2§§U —> 1§§Sb+ Z?Nb+4gn (13.27) Or, as another example, gn+ 2g§U —> 132x“ §§Sr + 2 am (13.28) The fragment products are radioactive nuclei; they emit [3 particles in succession to achieve stable end products. The energy released (the Qvalue ) in the fission reaction of nuclei like uranium is of the order of 200 MeV per fissioning nucleus. This is estimated as follows: Let us take a nucleus with A = 240 breaking into two fragments each ofA = 120. Then Elm for A = 240 nucleus is about 7.6 MeV, Elm for the two A = 120 fragment nuclei is about 8.5 MeV. Gain in binding energy for nucleon is about 0.9 MeV. Hence the total gain in binding energy is 24OXO.9 or 2 16 MeV. The disintegration energy in fission events first appears as the kinetic energy of the fragments and neutrons. Eventually it is transferred to the surrounding matter appearing as heat. The source of energy in nuclear reactors, which produce electricity, is nuclear fission. The enormous energy released in an atom bomb comes from uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion. We discuss some details in the next section how a nuclear reactor functions. 13.7.2 Nuclear reactor Notice one fact of great importance in the fission reactions given in Eqs. (13.26) to (13.28). There is a release of extra neutron (s) in the fission process. Averagely, 21/2 neutrons are released per fission of uranium nucleus.

We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If B is directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of a closed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then, BL = #0 Ie where Ie is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.

1268,1136,"96 BIOLOGY 6.4.1.3 Spring wood and autumn wood The activity of cambium is under the control of many physiological and environmental factors. In temperate regions, the climatic conditions are not uniform through the year. In the spring season, cambium is very active and produces a large number of xylary elements having vessels with wider cavities. The wood formed during this season is called spring wood or early wood. In winter, the cambium is less active and forms fewer xylary elements that have narrow vessels, and this wood is called autumn wood or late wood. The spring wood is lighter in colour and has a lower density whereas the autumn wood is darker and has a higher density. The two kinds of woods that appear as alternate concentric rings, constitute an annual ring. Annual rings seen in a cut stem give an estimate of the age of the tree. 6.4.1.4 Heartwood and sapwood In old trees, the greater part of secondary xylem is dark brown due to deposition of organic compounds like tannins, resins, oils, gums, aromatic substances and essential oils in the central or innermost layers of the stem. These substances make it hard, durable and resistant to the attacks of micro- organisms and insects. This region comprises dead elements with highly ligniﬁed walls and is called heartwood. The heartwood does not conduct water but it gives mechanical support to the stem. The peripheral region of the secondary xylem, is lighter in colour and is known as the sapwood. It is involved in the conduction of water and minerals from root to leaf. 6.4.2 Cork Cambium As the stem continues to increase in girth due to the activity of vascular cambium, the outer cortical and epidermis layers get broken and need to be replaced to provide new protective cell layers. Hence, sooner or later, another meristematic tissue called cork cambium or phellogen develops, usually in the cortex region. Phellogen is a couple of layers thick. It is made of narrow, thin-walled and nearly rectangular cells. Phellogen cuts off cells on both sides. The outer cells differentiate into cork or phellem while the inner cells differentiate into secondary cortex or phelloderm. The cork is impervious to water due to suberin deposition in the cell wall. The cells of secondary cortex are parenchymatous. Phellogen, phellem, and phelloderm are collectively known as periderm. Due to activity of the cork cambium, pressure builds up on the remaining layers peripheral",1

In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal cells along the veins modify themselves into large, empty, colourless cells. These are called bulliform cells. When the bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed water and are turgid, the leaf surface is exposed. When they are ﬂaccid due to water stress, they make the leaves curl inwards to minimise water loss. The parallel venation in monocot leaves is reﬂected in the near similar sizes of vascular bundles (except in main veins) as seen in vertical sections of the leaves. 6.4 SECONDARY GROWTH The growth of the roots and stems in length with the help of apical meristem is called the primary growth. Apart from primary growth most dicotyledonous plants exhibit an increase in girth. This increase is called the secondary growth. The tissues involved in secondary growth are the two lateral meristems: vascular cambium and cork cambium. 6.4. 1 Vascular Cambium The meristematic layer that is responsible for cutting off vascular tissues — xylem and pholem — is called vascular cambium. In the young stem it is present in patches as a single layer between the xylem and phloem. Later it forms a complete ring. 6.4.1.1 Formation of cambial ring In dicot stems, the cells of cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is the intrafascicular cambium.",1

The petty cash book generally has a number of columns for the amount on the payment side (credit) besides the ﬁrst other amount column. Each of the amount columns is allotted for items of specific payments, which are most common. The last amount column is designated as ‘Miscellaneous’ followed by a ‘Remarks’ column. In the miscellaneous column those payments are recorded for which a separate column does not exist. In the ‘Remarks’ the nature of payment is recorded. At the end of the period, all amount columns are totaled. The total amount column 1 shows the total amount spent and to be reimbursed. On the receipt (debit) side, there is only one amount column. Columns for the date, voucher number and particulars are common for both receipts and payments. Box 1 Advantages of Maintaining Petty Cash Book Saving of Time and efforts of chief cashier: The chief cashier is not required to deal with petty disbursements. He can concentrate on cash transactions involving large amount of cash. It saves time and labour and helps chief cashier to discharge his duties more effectively Effective control over cash disbursements: Cash control becomes easy because of division of work. The head cashier can control big payments directly and petty payments by keeping a proper check on the petty cashier. This way the chances of making frauds and embezzlements become very difficult. Convenient recording: Recording of petty disbursements in the main cash book makes it bulky and unmanageable. Further, the materiality principle requires that insignificant details need not be given in the main cashbook. This way the cash book reveals only material and useful information. Recording of such small payments becomes easy as the totals of different types of expenses are posted to ledger. It also saves time and effort of posting individual items in the ledger. In nutshell it can be stated that preparation of petty cash book is a cost reduction control measure.

They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically modified sugars (e. g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.). Exoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex polysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly homopolymers. 9.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS The other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid insoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are polynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these comprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell. For nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has three chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound, the second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or phosphate. As you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic acids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines while the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring is called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in polynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2’ deoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called ribonucleic acid (RNA). 9.7 STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS Proteins, as mentioned earlier, are heteropolymers containing strings of amino acids. Structure of molecules means different things in different contexts. In inorganic chemistry, the structure invariably refers to the molecular formulae (e.g., NaCl, MgClZ, etc.).

Physicists conjure up the three dimensional views of molecular structures while biologists describe the protein structure at four levels.

A more useful measure of the binding between the constituents of the nucleus is the binding energy per nucleon, Eb”, which is the ratio of the binding energy Eb of a nucleus to the number of the nucleons, A, in that nucleus: E = Eb/A (13.9) bn We can think of binding energy per nucleon as the average energy per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.

We notice the following main features of the plot: (i) the binding energy per nucleon, Ebn, is practically constant, i.e. practically independent of the atomic number for nuclei of middle mass number ( 3O <A< 170). 100 150 200 250 The curve has a maximum of about 8.75 MeV for A = 56 M b A ass Hum 6“ ) and has a value of 7.6 MeV FIGURE 13.1 The. binding energy per nucleon forA= 238. as a function of mass number. (ii) E bn is lower for both light nuclei (A<30) and heavy nuclei (A> l 70). We can draw some conclusions from these two observations: (i) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding energy of a few MeV per nucleon. (ii) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a consequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged. Consider a particular nucleon inside a sufﬁciently large nucleus. It will be under the inﬂuence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the range of the nuclear force. If any other nucleon is at a distance more than the range of the nuclear force from the particular nucleon it will have no inﬂuence on the binding energy of the nucleon under consideration. If a nucleon can have a maximum of p neighbours within the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be proportional to p. Let the binding energy of the nucleus be pk, where k is a constant having the dimensions of energy. If we increase A by adding nucleons they will not change the binding energy of a nucleon inside. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it and not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon would be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is approximately equal to pk. The property that a given nucleon 2019-20",0

Their motion is very similar to the motion of planets around the Sun and hence Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are equally applicable to them. In particular, their orbits around the earth are circular or elliptic. Moon is the only natural satellite of the earth with a near circular orbit with a time period of approximately 27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the rotational period of the moon about 2019-20 its own axis. Since, 1957, advances in technology have enabled many countries including India to launch artificial earth satellites for practical use in fields like telecommunication, geophysics and meteorology. We will consider a satellite in a circular orbit of a distance (RE + h) from the centre of the earth, where RE = radius of the earth. If m is the mass of the satellite and Vits speed, the centripetal force required for this orbit is mV2 F(centripetal) = —( R + h) (8.33) E directed towards the centre. This centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force, which is G m M E F(gravitation) = m (8.34) E where ME is the mass of the earth. Equating R.H.S of Eqs. (8.33) and (8.34) and cancelling out m, we get G M V2 : E —(RE +h) (8.35) Thus V decreases as h increases. From equation (8.35),the speed V for h = O is V2 (h=0) = GM/RE = gRE (8.36) where we have used the relation g =GM/RE2. In every orbit, the satellite traverses a distance 27t(RE+ h) with speed V. Its time period Ttherefore is 272(RE + h) _ 27r(RE + m3” V \fG—IVIE (8.37) on substitution of value of V from Eq. (8.35). Squaring both sides of Eq.

For a satellite very close to the surface of earth h can be neglected in comparison to RE in Eq. (8.38). Hence, for such satellites, Tis T), where T0 = 271'JRE /g (8.39) If we substitute the numerical values g : 9.8 m s2 and RE = 6400 km., we get 6.4><106 T22""— ° 7‘ 9.8 S Which is approximately 85 minutes.

A special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac function through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through the sympathetic nerves (part of AN S) can increase the rate of heart beat, the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output. On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component of ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action potential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones can also increase the cardiac output. 18.6 DISORDERS 0F CIRCULATORY SYSTEM High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is the term for blood pressure that is higher than normal (120/80).

Looking at plants have you ever wondered why and how there are so many shades of green in their leaves — even in the same plant? We can look for an answer to this question by trying to separate the leaf pigments of any green plant through paper chromatography. A chromatographic separation of the leaf pigments shows that the colour that we see in leaves is not due to a single pigment but due to four pigments: Chlorophyll a (bright or blue green in the chromatogram), chlorophyll b [yellow green), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids (yellow to yellow-orange). Let us now see what roles various pigments play in photosynthesis. Pigments are substances that have an ability to absorb light, at speciﬁc wavelengths. Can you guess which is the most abundant plant pigment in the world? Let us study the graph showing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure 13.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as well as the VIBGYOR. From Figure 13.3a can you determine the wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll a shows the maximum absorption? Does it show another absorption peak at any other wavelengths too? If yes, which one? Now look at Figure 13.3b showing the wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis occurs in a plant. Can you see that the wavelengths at which there is maximum absorption by chlorophyll a, i.e., in the blue and the red regions, also shows higher rate of photosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that chlorophyll a is the chief pigment associated with photosynthesis. But by looking at Figure 13.3c can you say that there is a complete one-to-one overlap between the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and the action spectrum of photosynthesis?",1

In the SI, it is measured in hertz : 1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s‘1 In simple harmonic motion [SHM], the displacement x (t) of a particle from its equilibrium position is given by, x (t) = A cos (cot + q) ) (displacement), in which A is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity (cot + (1)] is the phase of the motion, and q) is the phase constant. The angular frequency a) is related to the period and frequency of the motion by, a) = ? = 27W (angular frequency]. Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular motion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs. The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by, v (t) = —mA sin (cot + (p) (velocity), a (t) = —w2A cos [cot + (1)] = —(o2x [t] [acceleration], Thus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic motion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude vm=coA and acceleration amplitude am =co 2A, respectively. The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and is always directed towards the centre of motion. A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy K = 1/2 va and potential energy U = 1/2 W. If no friction is present the mechanical energy of the system, E = K + U always remains constant even though K and U change with time.

1280,1264,"BIOLOGY (ii) organic agriculture; and (iii) genetically engineered crop-based agriculture. The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but yet it was not enough to feed the growing human population. Increased yields have partly been due to the use of improved crop varieties, but mainly due to the use of better management practices and use of agrochemicals (fertilisers and pesticides). However, for farmers in the developing world, agrochemicals are often too expensive, and further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding. Is there any alternative path that our understanding of genetics can show so that farmers may obtain maximum yield from their ﬁelds? Is there a way to minimise the use of fertilisers and chemicals so that their harmful effects on the environment are reduced? Use of genetically modified crops is a possible solution. Plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation are called Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). GM plants have been useful in many ways. Genetic modification has: (i) made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt, heat). (ii) reduced reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops). (iii) helped to reduce post harvest losses. (iv) increased efﬁciency of mineral usage by plants (this prevents early exhaustion of fertility of soil). (v) enhanced nutritional value of food, e. g., golden rice, i.e., Vitamin ‘A’ enriched rice. In addition to these uses, GM has been used to create tailor-made plants to supply alternative resources to industries, in the form of starches, fuels and pharmaceuticals. Some of the applications of biotechnology in agriculture that you will study in detail are the production of pest resistant plants, which could decrease the amount of pesticide used. Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt for short). Bt toxin gene has been cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide resistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a bio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean etc. Bt Cotton: Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm), coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (ﬂies, mosquitoes). B. thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These crystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein. Why does this toxin not kill the Bacillus? Actually, the Bt tom'n protein exist as inactive protoxins but once an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form of toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals. The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and 2019-2020",1

POINTS TO PONDER The laws of reﬂection and refraction are true for all surfaces and pairs of media at the point of the incidence. The real image of an object placed between f and 2 f from a convex lens can be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is removed, is the image still there? This question puzzles many, because it is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air without a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point on the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging away. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our eye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in air during a laser show. Image formation needs regular reﬂection/ refraction. In principle, all rays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is why you do not see your image by an irregular reﬂecting object, say the page of a book. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in colour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours of the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an entirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in white light. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the angular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can keep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence have it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see. Without the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at 25 cm which would subtend a very small angle. 2019-20 343",0

The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall usually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. The protoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole and nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a holdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ — the frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual reproduction in most brown algae is by biﬂagellate zoospores that are pear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached ﬂagella. Sexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Union of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium (oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear two laterally attached ﬂagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota, Laminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b). 3. 1 .3 Rhodophyceae The members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of the predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body.

Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived. There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followed by prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase 1. 10.4.2 Meiosis II Prophase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually before the chromosomes have fully elongated. In contrast to meiosis I, meiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears by the end of prophase 11 (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become compact. Metaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator and the microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the kinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids. Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere of each chromosome (which was holding the sister chromatids together), allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by shortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.

1285,1498,"HOSZCHH CHAPTER ou have already learnt that the air i contains water vapour It varies from zero to four per cent by volume of the atmosphere and plays an important role in the weather phenomena. Water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely — gaseous, liquid and solid. The moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration. Thus, there is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation. Water vapour present in the air is known as humidity. It is expressed quantitatively in different ways. The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity. It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre. The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature. The absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth. The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity. With the change of air temperature, the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected. It is greater over the oceans and least over the continents. The air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be saturated. It means that the air at the given temperature is incapable of holding any additional amount of moisture at that stage. The temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air is known as dew point. WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE EVAPORATION AND CONDENSATION The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is added or withdrawn due to evaporation and condensation respectively. Evaporation is a process by which water is transformed from liquid to gaseous state. Heat is the main cause for evaporation. The temperature at which the water starts evaporating is referred to as the latent heat of vapourisation. Increase in temperature increases water absorption and retention capacity of the given parcel of air. Similarly, if the moisture content is low, air has a potentiality of absorbing and retaining moisture. Movement of air replaces the saturated layer with the unsaturated layer. Hence, the greater the movement of air, the greater is the evaporation. The transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation. Condensation is caused by the loss of heat. When moist air is cooled, it may reach a level when its capacity to hold water vapour ceases. Then, the excess water vapour condenses into liquid form. If it directly condenses into solid form, it is known as sublimation In free air, condensation results from cooling around very small particles termed as hygroscopic condensation nuclei. Particles of dust, smoke and salt from the ocean are particularly good nuclei because they absorb water. Condensation also takes place when the moist air comes in contact with some colder object and it may also take place when the temperature is close to the dew point. Condensation, therefore, depends upon the amount of cooling and the relative humidity of the air. Condensation is inﬂuenced by the volume of air, temperature, pressure and humidity. Condensation takes place: (i) when 2019-2020",2

This follows from the Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical to expect that two current-carrying conductors placed near each other will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In the period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this magnetic force and its dependence on the magnitude of the current, on the shape and size of the conductors, as well as, the distances between the conductors. In this section, we shall take the simple example of two parallel current- carrying conductors, which will perhaps help us to appreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.

In reaction [13.29(b)], two deuterons combine to form the light isotope of helium. In reaction (13.290), two deuterons combine to form a triton and a proton. For fusion to take place, the two nuclei must come close enough so that attractive short-range nuclear force is able to affect them. However, since they are both positively charged particles, they experience coulomb repulsion. They, therefore, must have enough energy to overcome this coulomb barrier. The height of the barrier depends on the charges and radii of the two interacting nuclei. It can be shown, for example, that the barrier height for two protons is ~ 400 keV, and is higher for nuclei with higher charges. We can estimate the temperature at which two protons in a proton gas would (averagely) have enough energy to overcome the coulomb barrier: (3/2)): T = K 2 400 keV, which gives T ~ 3 x 109 K. When fusion is achieved by raising the temperature of the system so that particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb repulsive behaviour, it is called thermonuclear fusion. Thermonuclear fusion is the source of energy output in the interior of stars. The interior of the sun has a temperature of l.5><107 K, which is considerably less than the estimated temperature required for fusion of particles of average energy. Clearly, fusion in the sun involves protons whose energies are much above the average energy. The fusion reaction in the sun is a multi-step process in which the hydrogen is burned into helium. Thus, the fuel in the sun is the hydrogen in its core. The proton-proton (p, p) cycle by which this occurs is represented by the following sets of reactions: }H+ }H—> 21H + e+ + v + 0.42 MeV (i) e+ + e‘ —> y+ y+ 1.02 MeV (ii) §H+ }H a 3He+ y+ 5.49 MeV (iii) gHe +3He —>‘;He+}H+}H+ 12.86 MeV (iv) (13.30) For the fourth reaction to occur, the first three reactions must occur twice, in which case two light helium nuclei unite to form ordinary helium nucleus. If we consider the combination 2(i) + 2(ii) + 2(iii) +(iv), the net effect is 41H+2e‘ —> §He+2v+6y+26.7MeV or (4}H+4e‘)—>(;He+2e—)+2v+6y+26.7Mev (13.31) Thus, four hydrogen atoms combine to form an :He atom with a release of 26.7 MeV of energy. Helium is not the only element that can be synthesized in the interior of a star. As the hydrogen in the core gets depleted and becomes helium, the core starts to cool. The star begins to collapse under its own gravity 2019-20",0

Today these rules are called the Principles or Laws of Inheritance: the First Law or Law of Dominance and the Second Law or Law of Segregation. 5.2. 1 Law of Dominance (1) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors. (ii) Factors occur in pairs. (iii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates (dominant) the other (recessive). The law of dominance is used to explain the expression of only one of the parental characters in a monohybrid cross in the F1 and the expression of both in the F2. It also explains the proportion of 3: 1 obtained at the F2. 5.2.2 Law of Segregation This law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending and that both the characters are recovered as such in the F2 generation though one of these is not seen at the F1 stage. Though the parents contain two alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair segregate from each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors. Of course, a homozygous parent produces all gametes that are similar while a heterozygous one produces two kinds of gametes each having one allele with equal proportion. 2019—2020 75",1

If in a population of size N, the birth rates (not total number but per capita births) are represented as b and death rates (again, per capita death rates) as d, then the increase or decrease in N during a unit time period t (dN/dt) will be dN/dt= (b—d) XN Let (b—d) =r, then dN/dt = rN The r in this equation is called the ‘intrinsic rate of natural increase’ and is a very important parameter chosen for assessing impacts of any biotic or abiotic factor on population growth. To give you some idea about the magnitude of r values, for the Norway rat the r is 0.015, and for the ﬂour beetle it is 0.12. In 198 1, the r value for human population in India was 0.0205. Find out what the current r value is. For calculating it, you need to know the birth rates and death rates. The above equation describes the exponential or geometric growth pattern of a population (Figure 1 3.6) and results in a J -shaped curve when we plot N in relation to time. If you are familiar with basic calculus, you can derive the integral form of the exponential growth equation as Nt = NO ert where Nt = Population density after time t N0 = Population density at time zero r = intrinsic rate of natural increase e = the base of natural logarithms (2.7 1828) Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous population densities in a short time.

The molecules in the paper gets polarised by the charged comb, resulting in a net force of attraction. If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction between hair and the comb reduces.

1292,104,"148 PHYSICS of Fig. 7.1 1 had different masses. How will you then determine the centre of mass of the lamina? 4 7.3 MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS Equipped with the definition of the centre of mass, we are now in a position to discuss its physical importance for a system of n particles. We may rewrite Eq.(7.4d) as MR: Zmiri =m1r1 +m2r2 +...+mnrn (7.7) Differentiating the two sides of the equation with respect to time we get dR dr1 dr2 drn M—=m1—+m2—+...+mn dt dt dt dt or MV=mlv1+m2v2+m+mnvn (7.8) where v1 (= dr1 / dt) is the velocity of the first particle v2 (=dr2/dt) is the velocity of the second particle etc. and V = dR/dt is the velocity of the centre of mass. Note that we assumed the masses m1, m2, etc. do not change in time. We have therefore, treated them as constants in differentiating the equations with respect to time. Differentiating Eq.(7.8) with respect to time, we obtain dV dv1 dv2 dv,L M—=m1—+m2 +...+m,l dt dt dt dt or MAzmla1 +m2a2 +...+mnan (7.9) where 1':11(=dv1 /dt) is the acceleration of the first particle, 32 (= dv2 / dt) is the acceleration of the second particle etc. and A (2 dV / dt) is the acceleration of the centre of mass of the system of particles. Now, from Newton’s second law, the force acting on the first particle is given by F1 = mla1 . The force acting on the second particle is given by F2 = m2a2 and so on. Eq. (7.9) may be written as MA=F1+F2+...+Fn (7.10) 2019-20 Thus, the total mass of a system of particles times the acceleration of its centre of mass is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the system of particles. Note when we talk of the force F1 on the first particle, it is not a single force, but the vector sum of all the forces on the ﬁrst particle; likewise for the second particle etc. Among these forces on each particle there will be external forces exerted by bodies outside the system and also internal forces exerted by the particles on one another. We know from Newton’s third law that these internal forces occur in equal and opposite pairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (7.10), their contribution is zero. Only the external forces contribute to the equation. We can then rewrite Eq. (7 . 10) as IWA=FM (7.11) where Fext represents the sum of all external forces acting on the particles of the system. Eq. (7.1 1) states that the centre of mass of a system of particles moves as if all the mass of the system was concentrated at the centre of mass and all the external forces were applied at that point. Notice, to determine the motion of the centre of mass no knowledge of internal forces of the system of particles is required; for this purpose we need to know only the external forces. To obtain Eq. (7. 1 1) we did not need to specify the nature of the system of particles. The system may be a collection of particles in which there may be all kinds of internal motions, or it may be a rigid body which has either pure translational motion or a combination of translational and rotational motion. Whatever is the system and the motion of its individual particles, the centre of mass moves according to Eq. (7 . 1 1). Instead of treating extended bodies as single particles as we have done in earlier chapters, we can now treat them as systems of particles. We can obtain the translational component of their motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass of the system, by taking the mass of the whole system to be concentrated at the centre of mass and all the external forces on the system to be acting at the centre of mass. This is the procedure that we followed earlier in analysing forces on bodies and solving",0

1294,1265,"LOCOMOT ION AND MOVEMENT Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle ﬁbres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle ﬁbre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this j unction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle ﬁbre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in CaH level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin ﬁlaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This Myosin head (Formation of cross bridge) / Figure 20.4 Stages in cross bridge formation, rotation of head and breaking of cross bridge Sliding / rotation pulls the attached actin ﬁlaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The ‘2’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘1’ bands get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The myosin, releasing the ADP and P1 goes back to its relaxed state. A new ATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4). The ATP is again hydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation",1
1295,109,"162 PIIYSICS vary from one point of the body to the other. If the body is so extended that g varies from part to part of the body, then the centre of gravity and centre of mass will not coincide. Basically, the two are different concepts. The centre of mass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends only on the distribution of mass of the body. In Sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the centre of mass of several regular, homogeneous objects. Obviously the method used there gives us also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if they are small enough. Figure 7.25 illustrates another way of determining the CG of an irregular shaped body like a cardboard. If you suspend the body from some point like A, the vertical line through A passes through the CG. We mark the vertical AAl. We then suspend the body through other points like B and C. The intersection of the verticals gives the CG. Explain why the method works. Since the body is small enough, the method allows us to determine also its centre of mass. bExample 7.8 A metal bar 70 cm long and 4.00 kg in mass supported on two knife-edges placed 10 cm from each end. A 6.00 kg load is suspended at 30 cm from one end. Find the reactions at the knife— edges. (Assume the bar to be of uniform cross section and homogeneous.) Figure 7.26 shows the rod AB, the positions of the knife edges K1 and K2 , the centre of gravity of the rod at G and the suspended load at P. Note the weight of the rod W acts at its centre of gravity G. The rod is uniform in cross section and homogeneous; hence G is at the centre of the rod; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP = 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK1= BK2= 10 cm and KlG = K2G = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the rod = 2019-20 4.00 kg and W1: suspended load = 6.00 kg; R1 and R2 are the normal reactions of the support at the knife edges. For translational equilibrium of the rod, R1+R2 —W1 —W = 0 (i) Note W1 and W act vertically down and R1 and R2 act vertically up. For considering rotational equilibrium, we take moments of the forces. A convenient point to take moments about is G. The moments of R2 and W1 are anticlockwise (+ve), whereas the moment of R1 is clockwise (-ve). For rotational equilibrium, —R1(K1G) + W1 (PG) + R2 (KZG) = 0 (ii) It is given that W: 4.009 N and W1 = 6.009 N, where 9 = acceleration due to gravity. We take 9 = 9.8 m/s2.

We now use an atomic standard of time, which is based on the periodic vibrations produced in a cesium atom. This is the basis of the cesium clock, sometimes called atomic clock, used in the national standards. Such standards are available in many laboratories. In the cesium atomic clock, the second is taken as the time needed for 9,192.63 1,770 vibrations of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of cesium- 133 atom. The vibrations of the cesium atom regulate the rate of this cesium atomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance wheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the vibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a quartz wristwatch. The cesium atomic clocks are very accurate. In principle they provide portable standard. The national standard of time interval ‘second’ as well as the frequency is maintained through four cesium atomic clocks. A cesium atomic clock is used at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi to maintain the Indian standard of time. In our country, the NFL has the responsibility of maintenance and improvement of physical standards, including that of time, frequency, etc. Note that the Indian Standard Time (IST) is linked to this set of atomic clocks. The efficient cesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they impart the uncertainty in time realisation as 2019-20 i l x 10—13, i.e. 1 part in 1013. This implies that the uncertainty gained over time by such a device is less than 1 part in 1013; they lose or gain no more than 3 us in one year. In View of the tremendous accuracy in time measurement, the SI unit of length has been expressed in terms the path length light travels in certain interval of time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 2.1). The time interval of events that we come across in the universe vary over a very wide range. Table 2.5 gives the range and order of some typical time intervals. You may notice that there is an interesting coincidence between the numbers appearing in Tables 2.3 and 2.5. Note that the ratio of the longest and shortest lengths of objects in our universe is about 1041. Interestingly enough, the ratio of the longest and shortest time intervals associated with the events and objects in our universe is also about 1041. This number, 1041 comes up again in Table 2.4, which lists typical masses of objects. The ratio of the largest and smallest masses of the objects in our universe is about (10“)? Is this a curious coincidence between these large numbers purely accidental ? 2. 6 ACCURACY, PRECISION OF INSTRUMENTS AND ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT Measurement is the foundation of all experimental science and technology. The result of every measurement by any measuring instrument contains some uncertainty. This uncertainty is called error. Every calculated quantity which is based on measured values, also has an error. We shall distinguish between two terms: accuracy and precision. The accuracy of a measurement is a measure of how close the measured value is to the true value of the quantity. Precision tells us to what resolution or limit the quantity is measured. The accuracy in measurement may depend on several factors, including the limit or the resolution of the measuring instrument. For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm. In one experiment, using a measuring instrument of resolution 0. 1 cm, the measured value is found to be 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.0 1 cm, the length is determined to be 3.38 cm.

1300,167,"352 l Physics and it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate from one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed his famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established that light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible light was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the wavelength of yellow light is about 0.6 mm. Because of the smallness of the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of typical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately travel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we had discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in which one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called geometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy propagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero. After the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40 years or so, many experiments were carried out involving the interference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only be satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus, around the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed to be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it was thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how could light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained when Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light. Maxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of electricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what is known as the wave equation from which he predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves*. From the wave equation, Maxwell could calculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found that the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed of light. From this, he propounded that light must be an electromagnetic wave. Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are associated with changing electric and magnetic ﬁelds; changing electric field produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing magnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The changing electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of electromagnetic waves (or light waves) even in vacuum. In this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the Huygens principle and derive the laws of reﬂection and refraction. In Sections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference which is based on the principle of superposition.

1301,1516,"192 Accountancy 6.6 Rectiﬁcation of Errors From the point of view of rectiﬁcation, the errors may be classiﬁed into the following two categories: (a) errors which do not affect the trial balance. (b) errors which affect the trial balance. This distinction is relevant because the errors which do not affect the trial balance usually take place in two accounts in such a manner that it can be easily rectified through a journal entry whereas the errors which affect the trial balance usually affect one account and a journal entry is not possible for rectiﬁcation unless a suspense account has been opened. Such errors are rectiﬁed by passing a nullifying entry in the respective account as explained before under 6.6.2. 6.6.1 Rectification of Errors which do not Affect the Trial Balance These errors are committed in two or more accounts. Such errors are also known as two sided errors. They can be rectified by recording a j ournal entry giving the correct debit and credit to the concerned accounts. Examples of such errors are — complete omission to record an entry in the books of original entry; wrong recording of transactions in the book of accounts; complete omission of posting to the wrong account on the correct side, and errors of principle. The rectiﬁcation process essentially involves: ° Cancelling the effect of wrong debit or credit by reversing it; and 0 Restoring the effect of correct debit or credit. For this purpose, we need to analyse the error in terms of its effect on the accounts involved which may be: (i) Short debit or credit in an account; and / or (ii) Excess debit or credit in an account. Therefore, rectification entry can be done by: (i) debiting the account with short debit or with excess credit, (ii) crediting the account with excess debit or with short credit. The procedure for rectiﬁcation for such errors is explained with the help of following examples: (a) Credit sales to Mohan ? 10,000 were not recorded in the sales book. This is an error of complete omission. Its affect is that Mohan’s account has not been debited and Sales account has not been credited. Accordingly, recording usual entry for credit sales will rectify the error. 2019-2020",3

What is growth? Growth can be defined as an irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or even of an individual cell. Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic processes (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of energy. Therefore, for example, expansion of a leaf is growth. How would you describe the swelling of piece of wood when placed in water? 15. 1. 1 Plant Growth Generally is Indeterminate Plant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited growth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence of meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems have the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however, soon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body. This form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the plant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth. What would happen if the meristem ceases to divide? Does this ever happen? In Chapter 6, you have studied about the root apical meristem and the shoot apical meristem. You know that they are responsible for the 2019-2020",1
1306,969,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS (iii) Migrate: The organism can move away temporarily from the stressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when stressful period is over. In human analogy, this strategy is like a person moving from Delhi to Shimla for the duration of summer. Many animals, particularly birds, during winter undertake long— distance migrations to more hospitable areas. Every winter the famous Keolado National Park (Bharatpur) in Raj asthan host thousands of migratory birds coming from Siberia and other extremely cold northern regions. (iv) Suspend: In bacteria, fungi and lower plants, various kinds of thick- walled spores are formed which help them to survive unfavourable conditions — these germinate on availability of suitable environment. In higher plants, seeds and some other vegetative reproductive structures serve as means to tide over periods of stress besides helping in dispersal — they germinate to form new plants under favourable moisture and temperature conditions. They do so by reducing their metabolic activity and going into a state of ‘dormancy’. In animals, the organism, if unable to migrate, might avoid the stress by escaping in time. The familiar case of bears going into hibernation during winter is an example of escape in time. Some snails and fish go into aestivation to avoid summer—related problems-heat and dessication. Under unfavourable conditions many zooplankton species in lakes and ponds are known to enter diapause, a stage of suspended development. 13. 1.3 Adaptations While considering the various alternatives available to organisms for coping with extremes in their environment, we have seen that some are able to respond through certain physiological adjustments while others do so behaviourally (migrating temporarily to a less stressful habitat). These responses are also actually, their adaptations. So, we can say that adaptation is any attribute of the organism (morphological, physiological, behavioural) that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its habitat. Many adaptations have evolved over a long evolutionary time and are genetically ﬁxed. In the absence of an external source of water, the kangaroo rat in North American deserts is capable of meeting all its water requirements through its internal fat oxidation (in which water is a by product). It also has the ability to concentrate its urine so that minimal volume of water is used to remove excretory products. Many desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and have their stomata arranged in deep pits (sunken) to minimise water loss through transpiration. They also have a special photosynthetic pathway (CAM) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time. Some desert plants like Opuntia, have no leaves — they are reduced to spines— and the photosynthetic function is taken over by the ﬂattened stems. 2019-2020",1

1309,1056,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS 1 1.6. 1 The Pressure Flow or Mass Flow Hypothesis The accepted mechanism used for the translocation of sugars from source to sink is called the pressure ﬂow hypothesis. (see Figure 1 1.10). As glucose is prepared at the source (by photosynthesis) it is converted to sucrose (a dissacharide). The sugar is then moved in the form of sucrose into the companion cells and then into the living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. This process of loading at the source produces a hypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up the phloem sap will move to areas of lower pressure. At the sink osmotic pressure must be reduced. Again active transport is necessary to move the sucrose out of the phloem sap and into the cells which will use the sugar — converting it into energy, starch, or cellulose. As sugars are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases and water moves out of the phloem. To summarise, the movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the source, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube. Loading of the phloem sets up a water potential gradient that facilitates the mass movement in the phloem. Phloem tissue is composed of sieve tube cells, which form long columns with holes in their end walls called sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass through the holes in the sieve plates, so forming continuous ﬁlaments. As hydrostatic pressure in the sieve tube of phloem increases, pressure ﬂow begins, and the sap moves through the phloem. Meanwhile, at the sink, incoming sugars are actively transported out of the phloem and removed Sugars leave sieve tubes; water follows by osmosis Tip of stem Sugar solution ﬂows to regions of low turgor pressure 1 Phloem for metabolism and storage; water follows by osmosis Root Sugars enter sieve tubes; water follows by osmosis Sugars leave sieve tube =High turgor pressure Figure11.10 Diagrammatic presentation of mechanism of translocation 191",1

The male accessory glands (Figure 3.1a, b) include paired seminal vesicles, a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these glands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium and certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps in the lubrication of the penis. 3.2 THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries alongwith a pair of oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in pelvic region (Figure 3.3a). These parts of the system alongwith a pair of the mammary glands are integrated structurally and functionally to support the processes of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care. Ovaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female gamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). The ovaries are located one on each side of the lower abdomen (Figure 3.3b). Each ovary is about 2 to 4 cm in length and is connected to the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments. Each ovary is covered by a thin epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma. The stroma is divided into two zones — a peripheral cortex and an inner medulla. 2019-2020",1
1311,698,"LAWS OF MOTION lOl since we are talking of uncharged and non- magnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic level, all bodies are made of charged constituents (nuclei and electrons) and the various contact forces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular collisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be traced to the electrical forces between the charged constituents of different bodies. The detailed microscopic origin of these forces is, however, complex and not useful for handling problems in mechanics at the macroscopic scale. This is why they are treated as different types of forces with their characteristic properties determined empirically. 5.9. 1 Friction Let us return to the example of a body of mass m at rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity (mg) is cancelled by the normal reaction force (N) of the table. Now suppose a force Fis applied horizontally to the body. We know from experience that a small applied force may not be enough to move the body. But if the applied force Fwere the only external force on the body, it must move with acceleration F/ m, however small. Clearly, the body remains at rest because some other force comes into play in the horizontal direction and opposes the applied force F, resulting in zero net force on the body. This force fS parallel to the surface of the body in contact with the table is known as frictional force, or simply friction (Fig. 5.10(a)). The subscript stands for static friction to distinguish it from kinetic friction fk that we consider later (Fig. 5.10(b)). Note that static friction does not (a) (b) Fig. 5.10 Static and sliding friction: (a) Impending motion of the body is opposed by static friction. When external force exceeds the maximum limit of static friction, the body begins to move. (b) Once the body is in motion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction which opposes relative motion between the two surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is usually less than the maximum value of static friction. exist by itself. When there is no applied force, there is no static friction. It comes into play the moment there is an applied force. As the applied force F increases, fS also increases, remaining equal and opposite to the applied force (up to a certain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it is called static friction. Static friction opposes impending motion. The term impending motion means motion that would take place (but does not actually take place) under the applied force, if friction were absent. We know from experience that as the applied force exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to move. It is found experimentally that the limiting value of static friction (f5 )max is independent of the area of contact and varies with the normal force (N) approximately as : (fs )m = MN (513) where us is a constant of proportionality depending only on the nature of the surfaces in contact. The constant [.15 is called the coefficient of static friction. The law of static friction may thus be written as fs 3 [.15 N (5.14) If the applied force F exceeds (f5 )max the body begins to slide on the surface. It is found experimentally that when relative motion has started, the frictional force decreases from the static maximum value (fs )max . Frictional force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is denoted by fk . Kinetic friction, like static friction, is found to be independent of the area of contact. Further, it is nearly independent of the velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for static friction: fk 2 #kN (5.15) where pk the coefficient of kinetic friction, depends only on the surfaces in contact. As mentioned above, experiments show that pk is less than [.15. When relative motion has begun, the acceleration of the body according to the second law is ( F —fk )/ m. For a body moving with constant velocity, F =fk. If the applied force on the body is removed, its acceleration is — fk / m and it eventually comes to a stop. The laws of friction given above do not have the status of fundamental laws like those for gravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They are empirical relations that are only 2019-20",0

Together such pairs will contribute zero to L l and as a result for symmetric bodies L i is zero, and hence L = L2 = Ian?

Soils are formed through the process of pedogenesis and depend upon the parent rocks, climate, biological activity and time. Time provides maturity to soils and helps in the development of soil profiles. Each element is important for human beings. Landforms provide the base on which human activities are located. The plains are utilised for agriculture. Plateaus provide forests and minerals. Mountains provide pastures, forests, tourist spots and are sources of rivers providing water to lowlands. Climate inﬂuences our house types, clothing and food habits. The climate has a profound effect on vegetation, cropping pattern, livestock farming and some industries, etc. Human beings have developed technologies which modify climatic elements in a restricted space such as air conditioners and coolers. Temperature and precipitation ensure the density of forests and quality of grassland. In India, monsoonal rainfall sets the agriculture rhythm in motion. Precipitation recharges the ground water aquifers which later provides water for agriculture and domestic use. We study oceans which are the store house of resources. Besides ﬁsh and other FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY sea-food, oceans are rich in mineral resources. India has developed the technology for collecting manganese nodules from oceanic bed. Soils are renewable resources, which inﬂuence a number of economic activities such as agriculture. The fertility of the soil is both naturally determined and culturally induced. Soils also provide the basis for the biosphere accommodating plants, animals and micro organisms. What is Geography? Geography is concerned with the description and explanation of the areal differentiation of the earth’s surface. Richard H artshome Geography studies the differences of phenomena usually related in different parts of the earth’s surface. Hettner The study of physical geography is emerging as a discipline of evaluating and managing natural resources. In order to achieve this objective, it is essential to understand the intricate relationship between physical environment and human beings. Physical environment provides resources, and human beings utilise these resources and ensure their economic and cultural development. Accelerated pace of resource utilisation with the help of modern technology has created ecological imbalance inthe world.

By the work-energy theorem mug/2 = fxo- If we confine our scope to mechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy of the block is ‘lost’ due to the frictional force. On examination of the block and the table we would detect a slight increase in their temperatures. The work done by friction is not ‘lost’, but is transferred as heat energy. This raises the internal energy of the block and the table. In winter, in order to feel warm, we generate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms together. We shall see later that the internal energy is associated with the ceaseless, often random, motion of molecules. A quantitative idea of the transfer of heat energy is obtained by noting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J of energy when it cools by10 °C. 6. 10.2 Chemical Energy One of the greatest technical achievements of humankind occurred when we discovered how to ignite and control fire. We learnt to rub two ﬂint stones together (mechanical energy), got them to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves (chemical energy), which then provided sustained warmth. A matchstick ignites into a bright ﬂame when struck against a specially prepared chemical surface. The lighted matchstick, when applied to a firecracker, results in a spectacular display of sound and light. 2019-20 Chemical energy arises from the fact that the molecules participating in the chemical reaction have different binding energies. A stable chemical compound has less energy than the separated parts. A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement of atoms. Ifthe total energy of the reactants is more than the products of the reaction, heat is released and the reaction is said to be an exothermic reaction. Ifthe reverse is true, heat is absorbed and the reaction is endothermic. Coal consists of carbon and a kilogram of it when burnt releases about 3 x 107 J of energy. Chemical energy is associated with the forces that give rise to the stability of substances. These forces bind atoms into molecules, molecules into polymeric chains, etc. The chemical energy arising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas, wood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily existence. 6. 10.3 Electrical Energy The ﬂow of electrical current causes bulbs to glow, fans to rotate and bells to ring. There are laws governing the attraction and repulsion of charges and currents, which we shall learn later. Energy is associated with an electric current. An urban Indian household consumes about 200 J of energy per second on an average. 6. 10.4 The Equivalence of Mass and Energy Till the end of the nineteenth century, physicists believed that in every physical and chemical process, the mass of an isolated system is conserved. Matter might change its phase, e.g. glacial ice could melt into a gushing stream, but matter is neither created nor destroyed; Albert Einstein (1 879- 1955) however, showed that mass and energy are equivalent and are related by the relation E = m 02 (6.20) where c, the speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 ><108 m s4. Thus, a staggering amount of energy is associated with a mere kilogram of matter E = 1x (3 X108)2 J = 9 ><1016 J. This is equivalent to the annual electrical output of a large (3000 MW) power generating station. 6. 10.5 Nuclear Energy The most destructive weapons made by man, the fission and fusion bombs are manifestations of",0

E(r): St 'I EI’IdWVXﬂ ON SYMMETRY OPERATIONS In Physics, we often encounter systems with various symmetries. Consideration of these symmetries helps one arrive at results much faster than otherwise by a straightforward calculation. Consider, for example an infinite uniform sheet of charge (surface charge density (S) along the y-z plane. This system is unchanged if (a) translated parallel to the y—z plane in any direction, (b) rotated about the x—axis through any angle. As the system is unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be. In particular, in this example, the electric ﬁeld E must be unchanged. Translation symmetry along the y—axis shows that the electric ﬁeld must be the same at a point (0, yl, O) as at (O, y2, 0). Similarly translational symmetry along the z—axis shows that the electric field at two point (0, O, 21) and (O, O, Z2) must be the same. By using rotation symmetry around the x—axis, we can conclude that E must be perpendicular to the y—z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the x—direction. Try to think of a symmetry now which will tell you that the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is a constant, independent of the x—coordinate. It thus turns out that the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld due to a uniformly charged inﬁnite conducting sheet is the same at all points in space. The direction, however, is opposite of each other on either side of the sheet. Compare this with the effort needed to arrive at this result by a direct calculation using Coulomb’s law. 41 2019-20",0

1319,1167,"234 Outer Inner mitochondrial — membrane BIOLOGY transport system is utilised in synthesising ATP with the help of ATP synthase (complex V). This complex consists of two major components, F1 and F0 (Figure 14.5). The F1 headpiece is a peripheral membrane protein complex and contains the site for synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. F0 is an integral membrane protein complex that forms the channel through which protons cross the inner membrane. The passage of protons through the ADP Pi channel is coupled to the catalytic site of the F1 component for the production of ATP. For each ATP produced, 2H+ passes through F0 from the Matrix Figure 14.5 Diagramatic presentation of ATP intermembrane space to the matrix down the synthesis in mitochondria electrochemical proton gradient. 14.5 THE RESPIRATORY BALANCE SHEET It is possible to make calculations of the net gain of ATP for every glucose molecule oxidised; but in reality this can remain only a theoretical exercise. These calculations can be made only on certain assumptions that: ’ There is a sequential, orderly pathway functioning, with one substrate forming the next and with glycolysis, TCA cycle and ETS pathway following one after another. ' The NADH synthesised in glycolysis is transferred into the mitochondria and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation. ' None of the intermediates in the pathway are utilised to synthesise any other compound. ° Only glucose is being respired — no other alternative substrates are entering in the pathway at any of the intermediary stages. But this ldnd of assumptions are not really valid in a living system; all pathways work simultaneously and do not take place one after another; substrates enter the pathways and are withdrawn from it as and when necessary; ATP is utilised as and when needed; enzymatic rates are controlled by multiple means. Yet, it is useful to do this exercise to appreciate the beauty and efﬁciency of the living system in extraction and storing energy. Hence, there can be a net gain of 38 ATP molecules during aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose.",1
1320,1269,"156 Potential Energy Figure 9.6 Concept of activation energy BIOLOGY Transition state towards the ‘active site’. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an ‘ES’ complex. E ACtiVatiOfl energy stands for enzyme. This complex formation is a transient phenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme active site, a new structure of the substrate called energy with enzyme transition state structure is formed. Very soon, after the expected bond breaking/making is completed, the product is released from the active site. In other words, the structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s). The pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called PrOdUCt (P) transition state structure. There could be progress of reaction many more ‘altered structural states’ between the stable substrate and the product. Implicit in this statement is the fact that all other intermediate structural states are unstable. Stability is something related to energy status of the molecule or the structure. Hence, when we look at this pictorially through a graph it looks like something as in Figure 9.6. The y-axis represents the potential energy content. The x—axis represents the progression of the structural transformation or states through the ‘transition state’. You would notice two things. The energy level difference between S and P. If ‘P’ is at a lower level than ‘S’, the reaction is an exothermic reaction. One need not supply energy (by heating) in order to form the product. However, whether it is an exothermic or spontaneous reaction or an endothermic or energy requiring reaction, the ‘S’ has to go through a much higher energy state or transition state. The difference in average energy content of ‘S’ from that of this transition state is called ‘activation energy’. Enzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the transition of ‘S’ to ‘P’ more easy. 9.12.3 Nature of Enzyme Action Each enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a highly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This complex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the unchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product complex (EP). The formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis.",1

Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also finds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants. Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show adaptations to diverse environments. 6. 1 THE TISSUES A tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing a common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues are classiﬁed into two main groups, namely, meristematic and permanent tissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing or not. 6. 1 . 1 Meristematic Tissues Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division called meristems (Gk. meristos: divided). Plants have different kinds of meristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and produce primary tissues are called apical meristems (Figure 6.1). 2019-2020",1
1322,1093,"318 BIOLOGY Figure 21.2 Diagrammatic representation of impulse conduction through an axon (at points A and B) becomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electrical potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the resting potential. You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation of nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is applied at a site (Figure 21.2 e. g., point A) on the polarised membrane, the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na’“. This leads to a rapid inﬂux of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site, i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and the inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane at the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the action potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites immediately ahead, the axon (e. g., site B) membrane has a positive charge on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a result, a current ﬂows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the outer surface current ﬂows from site B to site A (Figure 2 1.2) to complete the circuit of current ﬂow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and an action potential is generated at site B. Thus, the impulse (action potential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted. The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely short- lived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K’“. Within a fraction of a second, K’“ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting potential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the ﬁbre becomes once more responsive to further stimulation.",1
1323,222,"Nuclei the nuclear mass M is found to be always less than this. For example, let us consider 1:0 ; a nucleus which has 8 neutrons and 8 protons. We have Mass of 8 neutrons = 8 X 1.00866 u Mass of 8 protons = 8 X 1.00727 u Mass of 8 electrons = 8 X 0.00055 u Therefore the expected mass of 1SO nucleus = 8 X 2.01593 u = 16.12744 u. The atomic mass of 1860 found from mass spectroscopy experiments is seen to be 15.99493 u. Substracting the mass of 8 electrons (8 X 0.00055 u) from this, we get the experimental mass of ISO nucleus to be 1 5.99053 u. Thus, we find that the mass of the ISO nucleus is less than the total mass of its constituents by 0.1 369 1u. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents, AM, is called the mass defect, and is given by AM=[Zmp+(A—Z)mn]—M (13.7) What is the meaning of the mass defect? It is here that Einstein’s equivalence of mass and energy plays a role. Since the mass of the oxygen nucleus is less that the sum of the masses of its constituents (8 protons and 8 neutrons, in the unbound state), the equivalent energy of the oxygen nucleus is less than that of the sum of the equivalent energies of its constituents. If one wants to break the oxygen nucleus into 8 protons and 8 neutrons, this extra energy AM c2, has to supplied. This energy required Eb is related to the mass defect by Eb=AMc2 (13.8) Example 13.3 Find the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit, first in Joules and then in MeV. Using this, express the mass defect of 1860 in MeV/c2. Solution lu = 1.6605 x 10‘27 kg To convert it into energy units, we multiply it by c2 and find that energy equivalent = 1.6605 X 10—27 X (2.9979 X 108)2 kg mZ/s2 = 1.4924 x 10‘10 J 1.4924x10'10 1.602x 10—19 0.9315 x 109 eV 931.5 MeV or, 1u = 931.5 MeV/c2 For 1860, AM = 0.13691 u = 0.13691X931.5 MeV/c2 = 127.5 MeV/c2 The energy needed to separate 1860 into its constituents is thus 127.5 MeV/c2. eV If a certain number of neutrons and protons are brought together to form a nucleus of a certain charge and mass, an energy Eb will be released 2019-20 8'81 El’ldWVXﬂ 443",0

The potential energy expression then reads 2 q U'W) = q{V(1'1)— V(r2)]—m 0 (2.33) Here, rl and r2 denote the position vectors of +q and —q. Now, the potential difference between positions 1‘1 and 1'2 equals the work done in bringing a unit positive charge against field from 1'2 to II. The displacement parallel to the force is 2a cos0.

In this case, the work done against the external field E in bringing +q and — q are equal and opposite and cancel out, i.e., q [V(r1) — V(r2)]=0.

A mole of this substance is polarised (at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic field of magnitude 106 V m‘l. The direction of the ﬁeld is suddenly changed by an angle of 609. Estimate the heat released by the substance in aligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity, assume 100% polarisation of the sample. Solution Here, dipole moment of each molecules = 10‘29 C In As 1 mole of the substance contains 6 X 1023 molecules, total dipole moment of all the molecules, p = 6 X 1023 X 10’29 C m = 6 x 10‘6 c m Initial potential energy, Ul. = —pE cos 0 = —6X10‘6X106 cos ° = —6 J Final potential energy (when 9 = 60°), Lg = —6 x 1045 x 106 cos 60° = —3 J Change in potential energy = —3 J — (—6J) = 3 J So, there is loss in potential energy. This must be the energy released by the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles. 2.9 ELECTROSTATICS OF CONDUCTORS Conductors and insulators were described brieﬂy in Chapter 1. Conductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these charge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons part away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free within the metal but not free to leave the metal. The free electrons form a kind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move randomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift against the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei and the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic conductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but 2019-20 93 mama 67",0

A muscular tongue is present, which is bilobed at the tip and is used in capturing the prey. The alimentary canal consists of oesophagous, stomach, intestine and rectum, which open into the cloaca. The main digestive glands are liver and pancreas. It can respire in water through skin and through lungs on land. Circulatory system is closed with single circulation. RBCs are nucleated. Nervous system is organised into central, peripheral and autonomic. The organs of urinogenital system are kidneys and urinogenital ducts, which open into the cloaca. The male reproductive organ is a pair of testes. The female reproductive organ is a pair of ovaiies. A female lays 2500-3000 ova at a time. The fertilisation and development are external.

1330,599,"I28 PIIYSICS We point out a common misconception created by newspapers and magazines. They mention food values in calories and urge us to restrict diet intake to below 2400 calories. What they should be saying is kilocalories (kcal) and not calories. A person consuming 2400 calories a day will soon starve to death! 1 food calorie is 1 kcal. 4 6.10.6 The Principle of Conservation of Energy We have seen that the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved if the forces doing work on it are conservative. If some of the forces involved are non-conservative, part of the mechanical energy may get transformed into other forms such as heat, light and sound. However, the total energy of an isolated system does not change, as long as one accounts for all forms of energy. Energy may be transformed from one form to another but the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. Energy can neither be created, nor destroyed. Since the universe as a whole may be viewed as an isolated system, the total energy of the universe is constant. If one part of the universe loses energy, another part must gain an equal amount of energy. The principle of conservation of energy cannot be proved. However, no violation of this principle has been observed. The concept of conservation and transformation of energy into various forms links together various branches of physics, chemistry and life sciences. It provides a unifying, enduring element in our scientific pursuits. From engineering point of view all electronic, communication and mechanical devices rely on some forms of energy transformation. 6. 1 1 POWER Often it is interesting to know not only the work done on an object, but also the rate at which this work is done. We say a person is physically fit if he not only climbs four ﬂoors of a building but climbs them fast. Power is defined as the time rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. The average power of a force is defined as the ratio of the work, W, to the total time ttaken 2019-20 W t The instantaneous power is defined as the limiting value of the average power as time interval approaches zero, p:d_W dt The work dW done by a force F for a displacement dr is dW = F.dr. The instantaneous power can also be expressed as P=F.£ dt = F.v (6.22) where v is the instantaneous velocity when the force is F. Power, like work and energy, is a scalar quantity. Its dimensions are [MLQT’3]. In the SI, its unit is called a watt (W). The watt is l J s4. The unit of power is named after James Watt, one of the innovators of the steam engine in the eighteenth century. There is another unit of power, namely the horse-power (hp) 1 hp = 746 W This unit is still used to describe the output of automobiles, motorbikes, etc. We encounter the unit watt when we buy electrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and refrigerators. A 100 watt bulb which is on for l 0 hours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy. 100 (watt) x 10 (hour) = 1000 watt hour = l kilowatt hour (kWh) = 103 (W) x 3600 (s) = 3.6 x 106 J Our electricity bills carry the energy consumption in units of kWh. Note that kWh is a unit of energy and not of power. p: an (6.21) V Example 6.11 An elevator can carry a maximum load of 1800 kg (elevator + passengers) is moving up with a constant speed of 2 m s“.

The cleared blood is pumped back to the body through a vein after adding anti-heparin to it. This method is a boon for thousands of uremic patients all over the world. Kidney transplantation is the ultimate method in the correction of acute renal failures (kidney failure).

1333,813,"32 BIOLOGY Algae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the total carbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through photosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolved oxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount importance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form the basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of Porphyra, Laminaria and Sargassum are among the 7 0 species of marine algae used as food. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts of hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e. g., algin (brown algae) and carrageen (red algae) which are used commercially. Agar, one of the commercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used to grow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella a unicellular alga rich in proteins is used as food supplement even by space travellers. The algae are divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae. 3. 1 . 1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or ﬁlamentous. They are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The pigments are localised in deﬁnite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by ﬂagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara (Figure 3.1a). 3. 1 .2 Phaeophyceae The members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in marine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range from simple branched, ﬁlamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely branched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of 100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls. They vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown depending upon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in",1

This shows: v (3.140) Now we consider some special cases : (a) If vB = vA, vB—vA = 0. Then, from Eq. (3.13), xB (t) — xA (t) = xB (O) — xA (0). Therefore, the two objects stay at a constant distance (x8 (0) — xA (0)) apart, and their position—time graphs are straight lines parallel to each other as shown in Fig. 3.16. The relative velocity DAB or vBA is zero in this case. (b) If vA > v8, v3 — vA is negative. One graph is steeper than the other and they meet at a common point. For example, suppose vA = 20 m s‘1 and xA (O) = 10 m; and vB = 10 m s‘1,xB(O) = 40 m; then the time at which they meet is t = 3 s (Fig. 3.17). At this instant they are both at a position xA (t) = xB (t) = 70 m. Thus, object A overtakes object B at this time. In this case = 10m sr1 — 20m s*1 = — 10 m s*1=— DAB.

1335,618,"WAVES Fig. 1 5.9 Two pulses having equal and opposite displacements moving in opposite directions. The overlapping pulses add up to zero displacement in curve (c). According to this principle, each pulse moves as if others are not present. The constituents of the medium, therefore, suffer displacments due to both and since the displacements can be positive and negative, the net displacement is an algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 15.9 gives graphs of the wave shape at different times. Note the dramatic effect in the graph (c); the displacements due to the two pulses have exactly cancelled each other and there is zero displacement throughout. To put the principle of superposition mathematically, let y1 (x, t) and y2 (x, t) be the displacements due to two wave disturbances in the medium. If the waves arrive in a region simultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net displacement y (x, t) is given by y (x, t) = y,(x, t) + y2(x, t) (15.25) If we have two or more waves moving in the medium the resultant waveform is the sum of wave functions of individual waves. That is, if the wave functions of the moving waves are y1=f,(X—vt), yz =‘j;(x—Ut), y =fn(x—vt) 377 then the wave function describing the disturbance in the medium is y =f1(X— vt)+f2(x— vt)+ ...+fn(x— vt) Tl. = 'Zlfi (x—vt) (15.26) 1: The principle of superposition is basic to the phenomenon of interference.

The waves only differ in their initial phase. According to Eq.

The term potential energy brings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched bow-string possesses potential energy. When it is released, the arrow ﬂies off at a great speed. The earth’s crust is not uniform, but has discontinuities and dislocations that are called fault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crust are like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a large amount of potential energy. An earthquake results when these fault lines readjust. Thus, potential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue of the position or configuration of a body. The body left to itself releases this stored energy in the form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion of potential energy more concrete. The gravitational force on a ball of mass m is my . 9 may be treated as a constant near the earth surface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h of the ball above the earth’s surface is very small compared to the earth’s radius RE(h <<RE) so that we can ignore the variation of 9 near the earth’s surface*. In what follows we have taken the upward direction to be positive. Let us raise the ball up to a height h The work done by the external agency against the gravitational force is mgh This work gets stored as potential energy. Gravitational potential energy of an object, as a function of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it is the negative of work done by the gravitational force in raising the object to that height. V(h) = mgh If h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that the gravitational force F equals the negative of the derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus, d F=——V =— dh (h) mg The negative sign indicates that the gravitational force is downward. When released, the ball comes down with an increasing speed. Just before it hits the ground, its speed is given by the kinematic relation, v2 2 29h This equation can be written as l 2 h —mv=m 2 g which shows that the gravitational potential energy of the object at height h, when the object is released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of the object on reaching the ground. Physically, the notion of potential energy is applicable only to the class of forces where work done against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy. When external constraints are removed, it manifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically, (for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential * The variation of g with height is discussed in Chapter 8 on Gravitation. 2019-20",0

Thus. motion repeats itself after nT where n is an integer. Every periodic motion is not simple hamionic motion. Only that periodic motion governed by the force law F = — kx is simple harmonic. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse~square law force (as in planetary motion) as well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: —mar”r. In the latter case. the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y] must differ by TE/2. Thus. for example, a particle subject to a force —m(02r with initial position (0.

For linear simple harmonic motion with a given a). two initial conditions are necessary and sufficient to determine the motion completely. The initial conditions may be (i) initial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy and phase. 2019-20",0

1340,495,"LAWS OF MOTION 93 The property of inertia contained in the First law is evident in many situations. Suppose we are standing in a stationary bus and the driver starts the bus suddenly. We get thrown backward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch with the ﬂoor. If there were no friction, we would remain where we were, while the ﬂoor of the bus would simply slip forward under our feet and the back of the bus would hit us. However, fortunately, there is some friction between the feet and the ﬂoor. If the start is not too sudden, i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional force would be enough to accelerate our feet along with the bus. But our body is not strictly a rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some relative displacement between different parts. What this means is that while our feet go with the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is due to inertia. Relative to the bus, therefore, we are thrown backward. As soon as that happens, however, the muscular forces on the rest of the body (by the feet) come into play to move the body along with the bus. A similar thing happens when the bus suddenly stops. Our feet stop due to the friction which does not allow relative motion between the feet and the ﬂoor of the bus. But the rest of the body continues to move forward due to inertia. We are thrown forward. The restoring muscular forces again come into play and bring the body to rest. ’ Example 5.1 An astronaut accidentally gets separated out of his small spaceship accelerating in inter stellar space at a constant rate of 100 m 5’2. What is the acceleration of the astronaut the instant after he is outside the spaceship ? (Assume that there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him.) Answer Since there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him and the small spaceship exerts negligible gravitational attraction on him, the net force acting on the astronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is zero. By the first law of motion the acceleration of the astronaut is zero. 4 5.5 NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero. The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body. It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body. Momentum Momentum of a body is deﬁned to be the product of its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted by p: p = mv (5.1) Momentum is clearly a vector quantity. The following common experiences indicate the importance of this quantity for considering the effect of force on motion. 0 Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small car) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded truck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all know that a much greater force is needed to push the truck than the car to bring them to the same speed in same time. Similarly, a greater opposing force is needed to stop a heavy body than a light body in the same time, if they are moving with the same speed. 0 If two stones, one light and the other heavy, are dropped from the top of a building, a person on the gound will find it easier to catch the light stone than the heavy stone. The mass of a body is thus an important parameter that determines the effect of force on its motion. ' Speed is another important parameter to consider. A bullet ﬁred by a gun can easily pierce human tissue before it stops, resulting in casualty. The same bullet fired with moderate speed will not cause much damage. Thus for a given mass, the greater the speed, the greater is the opposing force needed to stop the body in a certain time. Taken together, the product of mass and velocity, that is momentum, is evidently a relevant variable of motion. The greater the change in the momentum in a given time, the greater is the force that needs to be applied. ' A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball coming in with great speed far more easily than a novice, who can hurt his hands in the act. One reason is that the cricketer allows a longer time for his hands to stop the ball. As you may have noticed, he draws in the hands backward in the act of catching the ball (Fig. 5.3). The novice, on the other hand, keeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the ball almost instantly. He needs to provide a much greater force to stop the ball instantly, and 2019-20",0

The self-induced emf is also called the back emf as it opposes any change in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays the role of inertia. It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics. So, work needs to be done against the back emf (8) in establishing the current. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the current I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is dW $441 If we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect, then using Eq.

For the transmission of genetic information, RNA is better. 6.3 RNA WORLD From foregoing discussion, an immediate question becomes evident — which is the ﬁrst genetic material? It shall be discussed in detail in the chapter on chemical evolution, but brieﬂy, we shall highlight some of the facts and points. RNA was the ﬁrst genetic material. There is now enough evidence to suggest that essential life processes (such as metabolism, translation, Figure 6.6 Watson-Crick model for semiconservative replication DNA splicing, etc.), evolved around RNA. RNA used to act as a genetic material as well as a catalyst (there are some important biochemical reactions in living systems that are catalysed by RNA catalysts and not by protein enzymes). But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and hence unstable. Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA with chemical modiﬁcations that make it more stable. DNA being double stranded and having complementary strand further resists changes by evolving a process of repair. 6.4 REPLICATION While proposing the double helical structure for DNA, Watson and Crick had immediately proposed a scheme for replication of DNA. To quote their original statement that is as follows: “It has not escaped our notice that the speciﬁc pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material” (Watson and Crick, 1953). The scheme suggested that the two strands would separate and act as a template for the synthesis of new complementary strands. After the completion of replication, each DNA molecule would have one parental and one newly synthesised strand. This scheme was termed as semiconservative DNA replication (Figure 6.6). 6.4. 1 The Experimental Proof It is now proven that DNA replicates semiconservatively. It was shown ﬁrst in Escherichia coli and subsequently in higher organisms, such as plants 2019—2020",1

At the two ends of the embryonal axis are present the radicle and the plumule (Figure 5.18). In some seeds such as castor the endosperm formed as a result of double fertilisation, is a food storing tissue and called endospermic seeds. In plants such as bean, gram and pea, the endosperm is not present in mature seeds and such seeds are called non- endospermous. 77 Seed coat Cotyledon Plumule Hilum Radicle Micropyle Figure 5.18 Structure of dicotyledonous seed 5.7.2 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed Generally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in orchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the seed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The endosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm separates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The embryo is small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It consists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum and a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle are enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza respectively (Figure 5.19).

The winds from the tropics converge at this low pressure zone. The converged air rises along with the convective cell. It reaches the top of the troposphere up to an altitude of 14 km. and moves towards the poles. This causes accumulation of air at about 30° N and S. Part of the accumulated air sinks to the ground and forms a subtropical high. Another reason for sinking is the cooling of air when it reaches 30° N and S latitudes. Down below near the land surface the air ﬂows towards the equator as the easterlies. The easterlies from either side of the equator converge in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Such circulations from the surface upwards and vice-versa are called cells. Such a cell in the tropics is called Hadley Cell. In the middle latitudes the circulation is that of sinking cold air that comes from the poles and the rising warm air that blows from the subtropical high. At the surface these winds are called westerlies and the cell is known as the Ferrel cell At polar latitudes the cold dense air subsides near the poles and blows towards middle latitudes as the polar easterlies. This cell is called the polar cell. These three cells set the pattern for the general circulation of the atmosphere. The transfer of heat energy from lower latitudes to higher latitudes maintains the general circulation. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY The general circulation of the atmosphere also affects the oceans. The large-scale winds of the atmosphere initiate large and slow moving currents of the ocean. Oceans in turn provide input of energy and water vapour into the air. These interactions take place rather slowly over a large part of the ocean. General Atmospheric Circulation and its Effects on Oceans Warming and cooling of the Pacific Ocean is most important in terms of general atmospheric circulation. The warm water of the central Pacific Ocean slowly drifts towards South American coast and replaces the cool Peruvian current. Such appearance of warm water off the coast of Peru is known as the El Nino. The El Nino event is closely associated with the pressure changes in the Central Pacific and Australia. This change in pressure condition over Pacific is known as the southern oscillation. The combined phenomenon of southern oscillation and El Nino is known as ENSO. In the years when the ENSO is strong, large-scale variations in weather occur over the world. The arid west coast of South America receives heavy rainfall, drought occurs in Australia and sometimes in India and ﬂoods in China. This phenomenon is closely monitored and is used for long range forecasting in major parts of the world. Seasonal Wind The pattern of wind circulation is modified in different seasons due to the shifting of regions of maximum heating, pressure and wind belts. The most pronounced effect of such a shift is noticed in the monsoons, especially over southeast Asia. You would be studying the details of monsoon in the book India: Physical Environment (NCERT, 2006). The other local deviations from the general circulation system are as follows. Local Winds Differences in the heating and cooling of earth surfaces and the cycles those develop daily or annually can create several common, local or regional winds. 2019-2020",2

The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to the magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same magnetic field. Some textbooks assign a magnetic charge (also called pole strength) +qmto the north pole and —qm to the south pole of a bar magnet of length 21, and magnetic moment qm(2l). The field strength due to qm at a distance r from it is given by ,uoqm/4at r2. The magnetic field due to the bar magnet is then obtained, both for the axial and the equatorial case, in a manner analogous to that of an electric dipole (Chapter 1). The method is simple and appealing.

The properties of numbers fascinated him, and in his work he anticipated major mathematical development of later times. Along with Wilhelm Welser, he built the first electric telegraph in 1833. His mathematical theory of curved surface laid the foundation for the later work of Riemann. The situation is radically different for magnetic ﬁelds which are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the Gaussian surfaces represented by® or ® in Fig 5.3(a) or Fig. 5.3(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is balanced by the number of lines entering it. The net magnetic ﬂux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true for any closed surface. FIGURE 5. 6 Consider a small vector area element AS of a closed surface S as in Fig. 5.6. The magnetic ﬂux through AS is deﬁned as A¢B = B-AS, where B is the ﬁeld at AS. We divide S into many small area elements and calculate the individual ﬂux through each. Then, the net ﬂux ¢B is, $3 = [ME = ZB-AS = 0 (5.9) 'all' 'all' where ‘all’ stands for ‘all area elements AS’. Compare this with the Gauss’s law of electrostatics. The ﬂux through a closed surface in that case is given by ZEAS = l 80 where q is the electric charge enclosed by the surface. The difference between the Gauss’s law of magnetism and that for electrostatics is a reﬂection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (also called monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinks of B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of dipoles and / or current loops.

1356,1375,"BIOLOGY 12.2.3 Molecular Diagnosis You know that for effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and understanding its pathophysiology is very important. Using conventional methods of diagnosis (serum and urine analysis, etc.) early detection is not possible. Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) are some of the techniques that serve the purpose of early diagnosis. Presence of a pathogen (bacteria, Viruses, etc.) is normally suspected only when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom. By this time the concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body. However, very low concentration of a bacteria or Virus (at a time when the symptoms of the disease are not yet visible) can be detected by ampliﬁcation of their nucleic acid by PCR. Can you explain how PCR can detect very low amounts of DNA? PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected AIDS patients. It is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients too. It is a powerful techqnique to identify many other genetic disorders. A single stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule (probe) is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the mutated gene will hence not appear on the photographic ﬁlm, because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene. ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens (proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) or by detecting the antibodies synthesised against the pathogen. 12.3 TRANSGENIC ANIMALS Animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an extra (foreign) gene are known as transgenic animals.

By introducing genes from other species that alter the formation of this factor and studying the biological effects that result, information is obtained about the biological role of the factor in the body.

Common Seal: The company being an artiﬁcial person, cannot sign its name by itself. Therefore, every company is required to have its own seal which acts as ofﬁcial signatures of the company. Any document which does not carry the common seal of the company is not binding on the company. Transferability of Shares: The shares of a public limited company are freely transferable. The permission of the company or the consent of any member of the company is not necessary for the transfer of shares. But the Articles of the company can prescribe the manner in which the transfer of shares will be made. May Sue or be Sued: A company being a legal person can enter into contracts and can enforce the contractual rights against others. It can sue and be sued in its name if there is a breach of contract by the company. 1.2 Kinds of Companies Companies can be classiﬁed either on the basis of the liability of its members or on the basis of the number of members. On the basis of liability of its members the companies can be classiﬁed into the following three categories: (1) Companies Limited by Shares: In this case, the liability of its members is limited to the extent of the nominal value of shares held by them.

Bright yellow, red and green coloured cockroaches have also been reported in tropical regions. Their size ranges from 14 inches to 3 inches (0.6-7 .6 cm) and have long antenna, legs and ﬂat extension of the upper body wall that conceals head. They are nocturnal omnivores that live in damp places throughout the world. They have become residents of human homes and thus are serious pests and vectors of several diseases. 7.4. 1 Morphology The adults of the common species of cockroach, Periplaneta americana are about 34-53 mm long with wings that extend beyond the tip of the abdomen in males. The body of the cockroach is segmented and divisible into three distinct regions — head, thorax and abdomen (Figure 7 . 14). The entire body is covered by a hard chitinous exoskeleton (brown in colour).

A complex protein Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for myosin on the actin ﬁlaments (Figure 20.3a). Each myosin (thick) ﬁlament is also a polymerised protein.

1365,1113,"THE LIVING WORLD organism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge of characters of an individual or group of organisms. This helps in identifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the same kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms. 1 .3. 1 Species Taxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with fundamental similarities as a species. One should be able to distinguish one species from the other closely related species based on the distinct morphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica, tuberosum and leo, represent the speciﬁc epithets, while the ﬁrst words Mangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another higher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than one speciﬁc epithets representing different organisms, but having morphological similarities. For example, Panthera has another speciﬁc epithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and melongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens which is grouped in the genus Homo. The scientiﬁc name thus, for human being, is written as Homo sapiens. 1.3.2 Genus Genus comprises a group of related species which has more characters in common in comparison to species of other genera. We can say that genera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato and brinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus Solanum Lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with several common features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differs from another genus Felis which includes cats. 1 .3.3 Family The next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still less number of similarities as compared to genus and species. Families are characterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of plant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum, Petunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals for example, genus Panthera, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put along with genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the features of a cat and a dog, you will ﬁnd some similarities and some differences as well. They are separated into two different families — Felidae and Canidae, respectively.",1

We note that the saturation currents are now found to be at higher values. This shows that more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the intensity of incident radiation. But the stopping potential remains the same as that for the incident radiation of intensity 11, as shown graphically in Fig. 1 1.3. Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the stopping potential is independent of its intensity. In other words, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source and the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident radiation. 1 1 .4.3 Effect of frequency of incident radiation on stopping potential We now study the relation between the T frequency v of the incident radiation and the stopping potential V0. We suitably adjust the same intensity of light radiation at various frequencies and study the variation of photocurrent with collector plate potential. The resulting variation is shown in Fig. 1 1.4. We obtain different values of stopping potential but the same value of the saturation current for incident radiation of different frequencies. The energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the incident radiations. The stopping potential is more negative for higher frequencies of incident radiation.

1368,1125,"190 BIOLOGY 1 1.5.2 Translocation of Mineral Ions After the ions have reached xylem through active or passive uptake, or a combination of the two, their further transport up the stem to all parts of the plant is through the transpiration stream. The chief sinks for the mineral elements are the growing regions of the plant, such as the apical and lateral meristems, young leaves, developing ﬂowers, fruits and seeds, and the storage organs. Unloading of mineral ions occurs at the ﬁne vein endings through diffusion and active uptake by these cells. Mineral ions are frequently remobilised, particularly from older, senescing parts. Older dying leaves export much of their mineral content to younger leaves. Similarly, before leaf fall in decidous plants, minerals are removed to other parts. Elements most readily mobilised are phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium. Some elements that are structural components like calcium are not remobilised. An analysis of the xylem exudates shows that though some of the nitrogen travels as inorganic ions, much of it is carried in the organic form as amino acids and related compounds. Similarly, small amounts of P and S are carried as organic compounds. In addition, small amount of exchange of materials does take place between xylem and phloem. Hence, it is not that we can clearly make a distinction and say categorically that xylem transports only inorganic nutrients while phloem transports only organic materials, as was traditionally believed. I 1.6 PHLOEM TRANSPORT: FLOW FROM SOURCE T0 SINK Food, primarily sucrose, is transported by the vascular tissue phloem from a source to a sink. Usually the source is understood to be that part of the plant which synthesises the food, i.e., the leaf, and sink, the part that needs or stores the food. But, the source and sink may be reversed depending on the season, or the plant’s needs. Sugar stored in roots may be mobilised to become a source of food in the early spring when the buds of trees, act as sink; they need energy for growth and development of the photosynthetic apparatus. Since the source-sink relationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can be upwards or downwards, i.e., bi-directional. This contrasts with that of the xylem where the movement is always unidirectional, i.e., upwards. Hence, unlike one-way ﬂow of water in transpiration, food in phloem sap can be transported in any required direction so long as there is a source of sugar and a sink able to use, store or remove the sugar. Phloem sap is mainly water and sucrose, but other sugars, hormones and amino acids are also transported or translocated through phloem.",1

However the nature of those ‘factors’ which determine the phenotype was not very clear. As these ‘factors’ represent the genetic basis of inheritance, understanding the structure of genetic material and the structural basis of genotype and phenotype conversion became the focus of attention in biology for the next century. The entire body of molecular biology was a consequent development with major contributions from Watson, Crick, Nirenberg, Khorana, Kornbergs (father and son), Benzer, Monod, Brenner, etc. A parallel problem being tackled was the mechanism of evolution.

The main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light gathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly depends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects can be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects distinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on the diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is to make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective in use has a diameter of 40 inch (~ 1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore, difficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult and expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that are free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions. For these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather than a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called reﬂecting telescopes. There is no chromatic aberration in a mirror. Mechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs much less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported over its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem with a reﬂecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside the telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right there, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage). This is what is done in the very large 200 inch (~5.08 m) diameters, Mt. Palomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the mirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deﬂect the light being focussed by another mirror.

Strict quality control testing for each product is also required. The downstream processing and quality control testing vary from product to product. SUMMARY Biotechnology deals with large scale production and marketing of products and processes using live organisms, cells or enzymes. Modern biotechnology using genetically modified organisms was made possible only when man learnt to alter the chemistry of DNA and construct recombinant DNA. This key process is called recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering. This process involves the use of restriction endonucleases, DNA ligase, appropriate plasmid or viral vectors to isolate and ferry the foreign DNA into host organisms, expression of the foreign gene, puriﬁcation of the gene product, i.e., the functional protein and finally making a suitable formulation for marketing. Large scale production involves use of bioreactors. EXERCISES 1. Can you list 10 recombinant proteins which are used in medical practice?

1374,54,"LAWS OF MOTION 5. 10. ll. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is simply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a body in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like tension. gravitational force. electrical force. friction. etc as the centripetal force in any circular motion. Static friction is a self—adjusting force up to its limit #5 N USS us N). Do not put f5: uSN without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming into play. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in equilibrium. The two forces mg and R can be different (eg. a body in an accelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third law. The terms ‘action' and ‘reaction' in the third Law of Motion simply stand for simultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in ordinary language. action does not precede or cause reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies. The different terms like 'friction'. 'normal reaction' ‘tension‘. ‘air resistance”. 'viscous drag'. 'thrust'. ‘buoyancy'. ‘weight'. ‘centripetal force' all stand for ‘force' in different contexts. For clarity. every force and its equivalent terms encountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B‘. For applying the second law of motion. there is no conceptual distinction between inanimate and animate objects. An animate object such as a human also requires an external force to accelerate. For example, without the external force of friction, we cannot walk on the ground. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the subjective concept of the ‘feeling of force”. On a merry—go—around. all parts of our body are subject to an inward force, but we have a feeling of being pushed outward — the direction of impending motion. 5.1 5.2 5.3 EXERCISES [For simplicity in numerical calculations, take 9 = 10 m s2) Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on (a) a drop of rain falling down with a constant speed, (b) a cork of mass 10 g ﬂoating on water, (c) a kite skillfully held stationary in the sky, [(1) a car moving with a constant velocity of 30 km/ h on a rough road, (e) a high-speed electron in space far from all material objects, and free of electric and magnetic fields.

These modiﬁcations increase the surface area enormously. Villi are supplied with a network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel called the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication. Mucosa also forms glands in the stomach (gastric glands) and crypts in between the bases of villi in the intestine (crypts of Lieberkuhn). All the four layers show modiﬁcations in different parts of the alimentary canal. 16. 1 .2 Digestive Glands The digestive glands associated with the alimentary canal include the salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas. Saliva is mainly produced by three pairs of salivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the sub- maxillary/sub-mandibular (lower jaw) and the sub- linguals (below the tongue). These glands situated just outside the buccal cavity secrete salivary juice into the buccal cavity. Liver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in an adult human. It is situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and functional units of liver containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of cords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called the Glisson’s capsule. The bile secreted by the hepatic cells passes through the hepatic ducts and is stored and concentrated in a thin muscular sac called the gall bladder.

Estrogens also regulate female sexual behaviour. Progesterone supports pregnancy. Progesterone also acts on the mammary glands and stimulates the formation of alveoli (sac-like structures which store milk) and milk secretion. 22.3 HORMONES 0F HEART, KIDNEY AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Now you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However, as mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues which are not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretes a very important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (AN F), which decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF is secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the blood pressure. The j uxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC). Endocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract secrete four major peptide hormones, namely gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Gastrin acts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both pancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and motility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called growth factors. These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues and their repairing/ regeneration. 22.4 MECHANISM OF HORMONE ACTION Hormones produce their effects on target tissues by binding to specific proteins called hormone receptors located in the target tissues only. Hormone receptors present on the cell membrane of the target cells are called membrane-bound receptors and the receptors present inside the target cell are called intracellular receptors, mostly nuclear receptors (present in the nucleus). Binding of a hormone to its receptor leads to the formation of a hormone-receptor complex (Figure 22.5 a, b). Each receptor is speciﬁc to one hormone only and hence receptors are speciﬁc. Hormone-Receptor complex formation leads to certain biochemical changes in the target tissue. Target tissue metabolism and hence 339",1

The stem is the ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. It develops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem bears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes. The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally green when young and later often become woody and dark brown. The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates. Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection and of vegetative propagation. 5.2.1 Modiﬁcations of Stem The stem may not always be typically like what they are expected to be. They are modiﬁed to perform different functions (Figure 5.6). Underground stems of potato, ginger, turmeric, zaminkand, Colocasia are modiﬁed to store food in them. They also act as organs of perennation to tide over conditions unfavourable for growth. Stem tendrils which develop from axillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb such as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines. Axillary buds of stems may also get modiﬁed into woody, straight and pointed thorns. Thorns are found in many plants such as Citrus, Bougainvillea. They protect plants from browsing animals. Some plants of arid regions modify their stems into ﬂattened (Opuntia), or ﬂeshy cylindrical (Euphorbia) structures. They contain chlorophyll and carry",1

1379,176,"Electrostatic Potential (ii) Equation (2.2) deﬁnes potential energy difference in terms of the physically meaningful quantity work. Clearly, potential energy so deﬁned is undetermined to within an additive constant.What this means is that the actual value of potential energy is not physically signiﬁcant; it is only the difference of potential energy that is signiﬁcant. We can always add an arbitrary constant a to potential energy at every point, since this will not change the potential energy difference: (UP+a)—(UR+a)=UP—UR Put it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point where potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to have electrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice, if we take the point R at inﬁnity, we get from Eq. (2.2) WNP = UP — Um = UP (2.3) Since the point P is arbitrary, Eq. (2.3) provides us with a definition of potential energy of a charge q at any point. Potential energy of charge q at a point (in the presence of ﬁeld due to any charge conﬁguration) is the work done by the external force (equal and opposite to the electric force) in bringing the charge q from inﬁnity to that point. 2.2 ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL Consider any general static charge configuration. We deﬁne potential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work done on the charge q. This work is obviously proportional to q, since the force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at that point due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore, convenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, so that the resulting quantity is independent of q. In other words, work done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric field associated with the charge conﬁguration. This leads to the idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given charge configuration. From Eq.

1380,759,"i Physics WHAT HAPPENS TO MY COMPASS NEEDLES AT THE POLES? A compass needle consists of a magnetic needle which ﬂoats on a pivotal point. When the compass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld at the location. Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic meridian of the place. In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals which cause the compass needle to deviate ﬁ‘om the magnetic meridian. Knowing the magnetic declination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true north. N T / compass face 360” free-ﬂoating needle that lines up with magnetic north (NH) // So what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole? At the poles, the magnetic ﬁeld lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible. If the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction, rendering it useless as a direction finder. What one needs in such a case is a dip needle which is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth. The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic ﬁeld makes with the vertical. At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down. Example 5.9 In the magnetic meridian of a certain place, the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field is 0.26G and the dip angle is 60°.

This technology has been demonstrated for cattle, sheep, rabbits, buffaloes, mares, etc. High milk-yielding breeds of females and high quality (lean meat with less lipid) meat-yielding bulls have been bred successfully to increase herd size in a short time. 9. 1 .3 Bee-keeping Bee-keeping or apiculture is the maintenance of hives of honeybees for the production of honey. It has been an age-old cottage industry. Honey is a food of high nutritive value and also ﬁnds use in the indigenous systems of medicine. Honeybee also produces beeswax, which ﬁnds many uses in industry, such as in the preparation of cosmetics and polishes of various kinds. The increased demand of honey has led to large-scale bee- keeping practices; it has become an established income generating industry, whether practiced on a small or on a large scale. Bee-keeping can be practiced in any area where there are sufﬁcient bee pastures of some wild shrubs, fruit orchards and cultivated crops. There are several species of honeybees which can be reared. Of these, the most common species is Apis indica. Beehives can be kept in one’s courtyard, on the verandah of the house or even on the roof. Bee-keeping is not labour-intensive. Bee-keeping though relatively easy does require some specialised knowledge and there are several organisations that teach bee-keeping. The following points are important for successful bee-keeping: (i) Knowledge of the nature and habits of bees, (ii) Selection of suitable location for keeping the beehives, (iii) Catching and hian of swarms (group of bees), (iv) Management of beehives during different seasons, and (v) Handling and collection of honey and of beeswax Bees are the pollinators of many of our crop species (see chapter 2) such as sunﬂower, Brassica, apple and pear. Keeping beehives in crop ﬁelds during ﬂowering period increases pollination efﬁciency and improves the yield—beneﬁcial both from the point of view of crop yield and honey yield. 9. 1.4 Fisheries Fishery is an industry devoted to the catching, processing or selling of ﬁsh, shellﬁsh or other aquatic animals.

1382,236,"488 l Physics EXAMPLE 14.6 fractional change in the majority carriers (i.e., An/ n) would be much less than that in the minority carriers (i.e., Ap/ p). In general, we can state that the fractional change due to the photo-effects on the minority carrier dominated reverse bias current is more easily measurable than the fractional change in the forward bias current. Hence, photodiodes are preferably used in the reverse bias condition for measuring light intensity. (ii) Light emitting diode It is a heavily doped p-n junction which under forward bias emits spontaneous radiation. The diode is encapsulated with a transparent cover so that emitted light can come out. When the diode is forward biased, electrons are sent from n —> p (where they are minority carriers) and holes are sent from p —> n (where they are minority carriers). At the junction boundary the concentration of minority carriers increases compared to the equilibrium concentration (i.e., when there is no bias). Thus at the junction boundary on either side of the junction, excess minority carriers are there which recombine with majority carriers near the junction. On recombination, the energy is released in the form of photons. Photons with energy equal to or slightly less than the band gap are emitted. When the forward current of the diode is small, the intensity of light emitted is small. As the forward current increases, intensity of light increases and reaches a maximum. Further increase in the forward current results in decrease of light intensity. LEDs are biased such that the light emitting efﬁciency is maximum. The V—I characteristics of a LED is similar to that of a Si junction diode. But the threshold voltages are much higher and slightly different for each colour. The reverse breakdown voltages of LEDs are very low, typically around 5V. So care should be taken that high reverse voltages do not appear across them. LEDs that can emit red, yellow, orange, green and blue light are commercially available. The semiconductor used for fabrication of Visible LEDs must at least have a band gap of 1.8 eV (spectral range of visible light is from about 0.4 um to 0.7 pm, i.e., from about 3 eV to 1.8 eV). The compound semiconductor Gallium Arsenide — Phosphide (GaAsHPx) is used for making LEDs of different colours. GaAsO_6 P04 (Eg ~ 1.9 eV) is used for red LED. GaAs (Eg ~ 1.4 eV) is used for making infrared LED. These LEDs find extensive use in remote controls, burglar alarm systems, optical communication, etc. Extensive research is being done for developing white LEDs which can replace incandescent lamps. LEDs have the following advantages over conventional incandescent low power lamps: (i) Low operational voltage and less power. (ii) Fast action and no warm-up time required. (iii) The bandwidth of emitted light is 100 A to 500 A or in other words it is nearly (but not exactly) monochromatic. (iv) Long life and ruggedness. (v) Fast on- off switching capability. 2019-20",0
1383,1415,"LIFE ON THE EARTH The producers are consumed by the primary consumers whereas the primary consumers are, in turn, being eaten by the secondary consumers. Further, the secondary consumers are consumed by the tertiary consumers. The decomposers feed on the dead at each and every level. They change them into various substances such as nutrients, organic and inorganic salts essential for soil fertility. Organisms of an ecosystem are linked together through a foodchain (Figure 15.1). For example, a plant eating beetle feeding on a paddy stalk is eaten by a frog, which is, in turn, eaten by a snake, which is then consumed by a hawk. This sequence of eating and being eaten and the resultant transfer of energy from one level to another is known as the food-chain. Transfer of energy that occurs during the process of a foodchain from one level to another is known as ﬂow of energy. However, food-chains are not isolated from one another. For example, a mouse feeding on grain may be eaten by different secondary consumers (carnivores) and these carnivores may be eaten by other different tertiary consumers (top carnivores). In such situations, each of the carnivores may consume more than one type of prey. As a result, the food- chains get interlocked with one another. This inter- connecting network of species is known as food web. Generally, two types of food-chains are recognised: grazing food-chain and detritus food-chain. In a grazing food-chain, the first level starts with plants as producers and ends with carnivores as consumers at the last level, with the herbivores being at the intermediate level. There is a loss of energy at each level which may be through respiration, excretion or decomposition. The levels involved in a food- chain range between three to ﬁve and energy is lost at each level. A detritus food-chain is based on autotrophs energy capture initiated by grazing animals and involves the decomposition or breaking down of organic wastes and dead matter derived from the grazing food-chain. Types of Biomes In the earlier paragraphs, you have learnt the meaning of the term ‘biome’. Let us now try to identify the major biomes of the world. There are ﬁve major biomes — forest, desert, grassland, 125 aquatic and altitudinal biomes. Some features of these biomes are given in Table l 5. 1. Biogeochemical Cycles The sun is the basic source of energy on which all life depends. This energy initiates life processes in the biosphere through photosynthesis, the main source of food and energy for green plants. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is converted into organic compounds and oxygen. Out of the total solar insolation that reaches the earth’s surface, only a very small fraction (0.1 per cent) is fixed in photosynthesis. More than half is used for plant respiration and the remaining part is temporarily stored or is shifted to other portions of the plant. Life on earth consists of a great variety of living organisms. These living organisms exist and survive in a diversity of associations. Such survival involves the presence of systemic ﬂows such as ﬂows of energy, water and nutrients. These ﬂows show variations in different parts of the world, in different seasons of the year and under varying local circumstances. Studies have shown that for the last one billion years, the atmosphere and hydrosphere have been composed of approximately the same balance of chemical components. This balance of the chemical elements is maintained by a cyclic passage through the tissues of plants and animals. The cycle starts by absorbing the chemical elements by the organism and is returned to the air, water and soil through decomposition. These cycles are largely energised by solar insolation. These cyclic movements of chemical elements of the biosphere between the organism and the environment are referred to as biogeochemical cycles. Bio refers to living organisms and geo to rocks, soil, air and water of the earth. There are two types of biogeochemical cycles : the gaseous and the sedimentary cycle. In the gaseous cycle, the main reservoir of nutrients is the atmosphere and the ocean. In the sedimentary cycle, the main reservoir is the soil and the sedimentary and other rocks of the earth’s crust.

(iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this system and all the forces on the system by the remaining part of the assembly. Include also the forces on the system by other agencies.

The free-body diagram of the system shows two forces on the system : the force of gravity due to the earth (270 N); and the normal force R’ by the ﬂoor. Note, the free-body diagram of the system does not show the internal forces between the block and the cylinder. Applying the second law to the system, this type is known as ‘a free-body diagram’. (Note this does not imply that the system under consideration is without a net force).

Homology is based on divergent evolution whereas analogy refers to a situation exactly opposite. Wings of butterﬂy and of birds look alike. They are not anatomically similar structures though they perform similar functions. Hence, analogous structures are a result of convergent evolution - different structures evolving for the same function and hence having similarity. Other examples of analogy are the eye of the octopus and of mammals or the ﬂippers of Penguins and Dolphins. One can say that it is the similar habitat that has resulted in selection of similar adaptive features in different groups of organisms but toward the same function: Sweet potato (root modification) and potato (stem modification) is another example for analogy. In the same line of argument, similarities in proteins and genes performing a given function among diverse organisms give clues to common ancestry. These biochemical similarities point to the same shared ancestry as structural similarities among diverse organisms. Man has bred selected plants and animals for agriculture, horticulture, sport or security. Man has domesticated many wild animals and crops.

However, in the collection carried out from the same area, but after industrialisation, i.e., in 1920, there were more dark-winged moths in the same area, i.e., the proportion was reversed. 2019—2020 131",1

However, there are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called co- factors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically active. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the apoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identiﬁed: prosthetic groups, co-enzymes and metal ions. Prosthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from other cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For example, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group and it is a part of the active site of the enzyme. Co-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with the apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of catalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of different enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components of many coenzymes are vitamins, e. g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin. A number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form coordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same time form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e. g., zinc is a cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase. Catalytic activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme which testiﬁes that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. SUMMARY Although there is a bewildering diversity of living organisms, their chemical composition and metabolic reactions appear to be remarkably similar. The elemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be similar when analysed qualitatively. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems when compared to inanimate matter. The most abundant chemical in living organisms is water. There are thousands of small molecular weight (< 1000 Da)",1
1387,1203,"CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE Let us now look at individual cell organelles to understand their structure and functions. 8.5. 1 Cell Membrane The detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent of the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on the cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled the scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane. These studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of lipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged in a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the polar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards the inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated hydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4). In addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol. Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes also possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies considerably in different cell types. In human beings, the membrane of the erythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids. Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be classiﬁed as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface of membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in the membrane.

Therefore, the total energy of the system, =1/2(50Nm'1X 0.1mX0.1m) = 0.25 J which is same as the sum of the two energies at a displacement of 5 cm. This is in conformity with the principle of conservation of energy. 4 14.8 SOME SYSTEMS EXECUTING SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION There are no physical examples of absolutely pure simple harmonic motion. In practice we come across systems that execute simple harmonic motion approximately under certain conditions. In the subsequent part of this section, we discuss the motion executed by some such systems. 14.8.1 Oscillations due to a Spring The simplest observable example of simple harmonic motion is the small oscillations of a block of mass m fixed to a spring, which in turn is fixed to a rigid wall as shown in Fig. 14.17. The block is placed on a frictionless horizontal surface. If the block is pulled on one side and is released, it then executes a to and fro motion about the mean position. Let x = 0, indicate the position of the centre of the block when the 2019-20 Fig. 1 4.1 7 A linear simple harmonic oscillator consisting of a block of mass m attached to a spring. The block moves over a frictionless surface. The box, when pulled or pushed and released, executes simple harmonic motion. spring is in equilibrium. The positions marked as —A and +A indicate the maximum displacements to the left and the right of the mean position. We have already learnt that springs have special properties, which were first discovered by the English physicist Robert Hooke. He had shown that such a system when deformed, is subject to a restoring force, the magnitude of which is proportional to the deformation or the displacement and acts in opposite direction. This is known as Hooke’s law (Chapter 9). It holds good for displacements small in comparison to the length of the spring. At any time t, if the displacement of the block from its mean position is x, the restoring force F acting on the block is, F(x) =—kx (14.19) The constant of proportionality, k, is called the spring constant, its value is governed by the elastic properties of the spring. A stiff spring has large k and a soft spring has small k. Equation (14.19) is same as the force law for SHM and therefore the system executes a simple harmonic motion. From Eq. (14.14) we have, a): E (14.20) m and the period, T, of the oscillator is given by, Tad? (14.21) Stiff springs have high value of k (spring constant). A block of small mass m attached to a stiff spring will have, according to Eq. (14.20), large oscillation frequency, as expected physically.",0

The radius of the circle (rlor r2) is the perpendicular distance of the point (P1 or P2) from the axis. A point on the axis like P3 remains stationary). every particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Fig. 7 .4 shows the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis (the z—axis of the frame of reference). Let P1 be a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen and at a distance r1 from fixed axis. The particle P1 describes a circle of radius r1 with its centre C1 on the fixed axis. The circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows another particle P2 of the rigid body, P2 is at a distance r2 from the fixed axis. The particle P2 moves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2 on the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis. Note that the circles described by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes; both these planes, however, are perpendicular to the fixed axis. For any particle on the axis like P3, r = 0. Any such particle remains stationary while the body rotates. This is expected since the axis of rotation is fixed.

The pivot of the fan, point 0, is ﬁxed. The blades of the fan are under rotational motion, whereas, the axis of rotation of the fan blades is oscillating.

(We assume that the top does not slip from place to place and so does not have translational motion.) We know from experience that the axis of such a spinning top moves around the vertical through its point of contact with the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown in Fig. 7 .5(a). (This movement of the axis of the top around the vertical is termed precession.) Note, the point of contact of the top with ground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the top at any instant passes through the point of contact. Another simple example of this kind of rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal fan [Fig.7 .5(b)].

1397,1252,"HUMAN REPRODUCTION blastomeres is called a morula (Figure 3.1 1e). The morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 3.1 1g) as it moves further into the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast and an inner group of cells attached to trophoblast called the inner cell mass. The trophoblast layer then gets attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers the blastocyst. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the endometrium of the uterus (Figure 3.1 1h). This is called implantation and it leads to pregnancy. 3.6 PREGNANCY AND EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT After implantation, fmger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called chorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal blood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between developing embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta (Figure 3. 12). The placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials produced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from the embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces several hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (hPL), estrogens, progestogens, etc. In the later phase of pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin is also secreted by the ovary. Let us remember that hCG, hPL and relaxin Placental villi are produced in women ” only during pregnancy. In addition, during pregnancy the levels of other hormones like estrogens, progestogens, . . .

1399,527,"376 PHYSICS are much more difficult to compress than gases and so have much higher values of bulk modulus. Now, see Eq. (15.19). Solids and liquids have higher mass densities { p ) than gases. But the corresponding increase in both the modulus (B) of solids and liquids is much higher. This is the reason why the sound waves travel faster in solids and liquids. We can estimate the speed of sound in a gas in the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas, the pressure P, volume Vand temperature T are related by (see Chapter 1 1). PV= NkBT (15.21) where N is the number of molecules in volume V, k3 is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for an isothermal change it follows from Eq.(15.2 1) that VAP + PAV = 0 AP or _ = AV/ V P Hence, substituting in Eq. (15.16), we have B = P Therefore, from Eq. (15.19) the speed of a longitudinal wave in an ideal gas is given by, v = E (15.22) p This relation was ﬁrst given by Newton and is known as Newton’s formula. Example 1 5.4 Estimate the speed of sound in air at standard temperature and pressure. The mass of 1 mole of air is 29.0 X10‘3k. Answer We know that 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 litres at STP. Therefore, density of air at STP is: p0 = (mass of one mole of air)/ (volume of one mole of air at STP) _ 29.0x10‘3 kg 22.4x10‘3 m3 = 1.29 kg m—3 According to Newton’s formula for the speed of sound in a medium, we get for the speed of sound in air at STP, 1.01x105Nm'2 1.29 kgm“3 1/2 ] =280mS'1 (15.23) 4 2019-20 The result shown in Eq.(15.23) is about 15% smaller as compared to the experimental value of 331 m S'1 as given in Table 15.1. Where did we go wrong ? If we examine the basic assumption made by Newton that the pressure variations in a medium during propagation of sound are isothermal, we find that this is not correct. It was pointed out by Laplace that the pressure variations in the propagation of sound waves are so fast that there is little time for the heat ﬂow to maintain constant temperature. These variations, therefore, are adiabatic and not isothermal. For adiabatic processes the ideal gas satisfies the relation (see Section 12.8), PV” = constant i.e. A(PV7) = O or PyVV‘1 AV+ VYAP= o where y is the ratio of two specific heats, Cp/Cv. Thus, for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk modulus is given by, B = _ AP “‘1 AV/V = IYp The speed of sound is, therefore, from Eq. (15.19), givenby, v = (ﬂ (1524) p This modiﬁcation of Newton’s formula is referred to as the Laplace correction. For air 7: 7/5. Now using Eq. (15.24) to estimate the speed of sound in air at STP, we get a value 331.3 In 8—1, which agrees with the measured speed. 15.5 THE PRINCIPLE 0F SUPERPOSITION OFWAVES What happens when two wave pulses travelling in opposite directions cross each other (Fig. 15.9)? It turns out that wave pulses continue to retain their identities after they have crossed. However, during the time they overlap, the wave pattern is different from either of the pulses. Figure 15.9 shows the situation when two pulses of equal and opposite shapes move towards each other. When the pulses overlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of the displacement due to each pulse. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves.",0
1400,1124,"BIOLOGY There is a convention in deﬁning the two strands of the DNA in the structural gene of a transcription unit. Since the two strands have opposite polarity and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase also catalyse the polymerisation in only one direction, that is, 5'—>3', the strand that has the polarity 3'—>5' acts as a template, and is also referred to as template strand. The other strand which has the polarity (5'—>3') and the sequence same as RNA (except thymine at the place of uracil), is displaced during transcription. Strangely, this strand (which does not code for anything) is referred to as coding strand. All the reference point while deﬁning a transcription unit is made with coding strand. To explain the point, a hypothetical sequence from a transcription unit is represented below: 3'-ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC-5' Template Strand 5'-TACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG-3' Coding Strand Can you now write the sequence of RNA transcribed ﬁom the above DNA? Transcription start site Promoter Terminator Structural gene Template strand Coding strand Figure 6.9 Schematic structure of a transcription unit The promoter and terminator ﬂank the structural gene in a transcription unit. The promoter is said to be located towards 5'-end (upstream) of the structural gene (the reference is made with respect to the polarity of coding strand). It is a DNA sequence that provides binding site for RNA polymerase, and it is the presence of a promoter in a transcription unit that also deﬁnes the template and coding strands. By switching its position with terminator, the deﬁnition of coding and template strands could be reversed. The terminator is located towards 3'-end (downstream) of the coding strand and it usually deﬁnes the end of the process of transcription (Figure 6.9). There are additional regulatory sequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the promoter. Some of the properties of these sequences shall be discussed while dealing with regulation of gene expression. 6.5.2 Transcription Unit and the Gene A gene is deﬁned as the functional unit of inheritance.

1401,731,"wavelength extends all over space. By Born’s probability interpretation this means that the electron is not localised in any ﬁnite region of space. That is, its position uncertainty is inﬁnite (Ax a co), which is consistent with the uncertainty principle. In general, the matter wave associated with the electron is not extended all over space. It is a wave packet extending over some ﬁnite region of space. In that case Axis not inﬁnite but has some ﬁnite value depending on the extension of the wave packet. Also, you must appreciate that a wave packet of ﬁnite extension does not have a single wavelength. It is built up of wavelengths spread around some central wavelength. By de Broglie’s relation, then, the momentum of the electron will also have a spread — an uncertainty Ap. This is as expected from the uncertainty principle. It can be shown that the wave packet description together with de Broglie relation and Born’s probability interpretation reproduce the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle exactly. In Chapter 12, the de Broglie relation will be seen to justify Bohr’s postulate on quantisation of angular momentum of electron in an atom.

(Hint: The earth has an electric field of about 100 Vm’1 at its surface in the downward direction, corresponding to a surface charge density = —10’9 C m’2. Due to the slight conductivity of the atmosphere up to about 50 km (beyond which it is good conductor), about + 1800 C is pumped every second into the earth as a whole.

1403,197,"Nuclei different mass unit is used for expressing atomic masses. This unit is the atomic mass unit (u), deﬁned as 1 / 12th of the mass of the carbon (12C) atom. According to this definition mass of one 12C atom 12 1u= _ 1.992647 x10-26 kg _ 12 = 1.660539 ><10‘27 kg (13.1) The atomic masses of various elements expressed in atomic mass unit (u) are close to being integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen atom. There are, however, many striking exceptions to this rule. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine atom is 35.46 u. Accurate measurement of atomic masses is carried out with a mass spectrometer, The measurement of atomic masses reveals the existence of different types of atoms of the same element, which exhibit the same chemical properties, but differ in mass. Such atomic species of the same element differing in mass are called isotopes. (In Greek, isotope means the same place, i.e. they occur in the same place in the periodic table of elements.) It was found that practically every element consists of a mixture of several isotopes. The relative abundance of different isotopes differs from element to element. Chlorine, for example, has two isotopes having masses 34.98 u and 36.98 u, which are nearly integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen atom. The relative abundances of these isotopes are 75.4 and 24.6 per cent, respectively. Thus, the average mass of a chlorine atom is obtained by the weighted average of the masses of the two isotopes, which works out to be = 75.4><34.98+ 24.6>< 36.98 100 = 35.47 u which agrees with the atomic mass of chlorine. Even the lightest element, hydrogen has three isotopes having masses 1.0078 u, 2.0141 u, and 3.0160 u. The nucleus of the lightest atom of hydrogen, which has a relative abundance of 99.985%, is called the proton. The mass of a proton is m = 1.0072711 = 1.67262 x 10—27 k (13.2) p g This is equal to the mass of the hydrogen atom (= 1 .00783u), minus the mass of a single electron (me= 0.00055 u). The other two isotopes of hydrogen are called deuterium and tritium. Tritium nuclei, being unstable, do not occur naturally and are produced artificially in laboratories. The positive charge in the nucleus is that of the protons. A proton carries one unit of fundamental charge and is stable. It was earlier thought that the nucleus may contain electrons, but this was ruled out later using arguments based on quantum theory. All the electrons of an atom are outside the nucleus. We know that the number of these electrons outside the nucleus of the atom is Z, the atomic number. The total charge of the 2019-20 439",0

In other words, unlike the way a magnet attracts metals like iron, it would repel a diamagnetic substance. Figure 5. 1 2(a) shows a bar of diamagnetic material placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld lines are repelled or expelled and the ﬁeld inside the material is reduced. In most cases, as is evident from Table 5.2, this reduction is slight, being one part in 105. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld, the bar will tend to move from high to low ﬁeld. The simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in an atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum. These orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus possess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones in which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic field is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the same direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up. This happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law which you will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic moment in direction opposite to that of the applied ﬁeld and hence repulsion. Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon, nitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present in all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it gets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc. The most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors. These are metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect conductivity and perfect diamagnetism Here the ﬁeld lines are completely expelled! = —1 and ur = O. A superconductor repels a magnet and (by Newton’s third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect diamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect, after the name of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully exploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically levitated superfast trains. 5.6.2 Paramagnetism Paramagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld. They have tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic ﬁeld to strong magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., they get weakly attracted to a magnet. 2019-20",0
1405,804,"CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION The stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is called the cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase — a period of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) — the actual period of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S and G2. G1 phase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism. Most of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks the phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G2 phase is the period of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namely prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensation occurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the opposite poles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindle ﬁbres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes at the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and the chromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles. Once the chromatids reach the two poles, the chromosomal elongation starts, nucleolus and the nuclear membrane reappear. This stage is called the telophaise. ‘ Nuclear division is then followed by the cytoplasmic d1v1s10n and is callé‘di'cytoklnes1s Mitosis thus, is the equational division i Gill ch the chromosome number of Meiosis is divided into two ph se .. division the homologous chromosomes pair orm bivalents, and undergo crossing over. Meiosis I has a long prophase, which‘ is divided further into ﬁve phases. These are leptotene, zygotene, pachytene diplotene and diakinesis. During metaphase I the bivalents arrange on the equatorial plate. This is followed by anaphase I in which homologous chromosomes move to the opposite poles with both their chromatids. Each pole receives half the chromosome number of the parent cell. In telophase I, the nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis. During anaphase II the sister chromatids separate. Thus at the end of meiosis four haploid cells are formed. EXERCISES 1. What is the average cell cycle span for a mammalian cell? 2.

1406,940,"ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES natural aging of a lake may span thousands of years. However, pollutants from man’s activities like efﬂuents from the industries and homes can radically accelerate the aging process. This phenomenon has been called Cultural or Accelerated Eutrophication. During the past century, lakes in many parts of the earth have been severely eutrophied by sewage and agricultural and industrial wastes. The prime contaminants are nitrates and phosphates, which act as plant nutrients. They overstimulate the growth of algae, causing unsightly scum and unpleasant odours, and robbing the water of dissolved oxygen Vital to other aquatic life. At the same time, other pollutants ﬂowing into a lake may poison whole populations of ﬁsh, whose decomposing remains further deplete the water’s dissolved oxygen content. In such fashion, a lake can literally choke to death. Heated (thermal) wastewaters ﬂowing out of electricity-generating units, e.g., thermal power plants, constitute another important category of pollutants. Thermal wastewater eliminates or reduces the number of organisms sensitive to high temperature, and may enhance the growth of plants and ﬁsh in extremely cold areas but, only after causing damage to the indigenous ﬂora and fauna. 16.2.2 A Case Study of Integrated Waste Water Treatment Wastewater including sewage can be treated in an integrated manner, by utilising a mix of artiﬁcial and natural processes. An example of such an initiative is the town of Arcata, situated along the northern coast of California. Collaborating with biologists from the Humboldt State University, the townspeople created an integrated waste water treatment process within a natural system. The cleaning occurs in two stages — (a) the conventional sedimentation, ﬁltering and chlorine treatments are given. After this stage, lots of dangerous pollutants like dissolved heavy metals still remain. To combat this, an innovative approach was taken and (b) the biologists developed a series of six connected marshes over 60 hectares of marshland. Appropriate plants, algae, fungi and bacteria were seeded into this area, which neutralise, absorb and assimilate the pollutants. Hence, as the water ﬂows through the marshes, it gets puriﬁed naturally. The marshes also constitute a sanctuary, with a high level of biodiversity in the form of ﬁshes, animals and birds that now reside there. A citizens group called Friends of the Arcata Marsh (FOAM) are responsible for the upkeep and safeguarding of this wonderful project. . All this time, we have assumed that removal of wastes requires water, i.e., the creation of sewage. But what if water is not necessary to dispose off human waste, like excreta? Can you imagine the amount of water that one can save if one didn’t have to ﬂush the toilet? Well, this is already a reality.

1407,351,"LAWS OF MOTION 91 In practice, the ball does come to a stop after moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane, because of the opposing force of friction which can never be totally eliminated. However, if there were no friction, the ball would continue to move with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane. Galileo thus, arrived at a new insight on motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who followed him. The state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times. Newton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws of motion that go by his name. Galileo’s law of inertia was his starting point which he formulated as the first law of motion: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise. Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force. the cause of motion. was thought to be of diﬁerent kinds : force due to continuous pressure [nodan]. as the force of wind on a sailing vessel; impact [abhighat). as when a potter's rod strikes the wheel: persistent tendency [sanskara] to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body: transmitted force by a string. rod. etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega. the tendency to move in a straight line. was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere. a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational. rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole [patan) and also rotational and vibrational motion [bhraman. spandan). but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a deﬁnite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. It was known that the position of a particle in space can be indicated by distance measured along three axes. Bhaskara [1150 AD.) had introduced the concept of ‘instantaneous motion' [tatkaliki gati']. which anticipated the modem notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood: a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and ﬂuidity while a wave results no net force acting on the body. It is incorrect to assume that a net force is needed to keep a body in uniform motion. To maintain a body in uniform motion, we need to apply an external force to ecounter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. To summarise, if the net external force is zero, a body at rest continues to remain at rest and a body in motion continues to move with a uniform velocity. This property of the body is called inertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to change’. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion, unless an external force compels it to change that state. 5.4 NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION Galileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas dethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new mechanics had to be developed. This task was from the transmission of vibrations of water particles. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can, therefore, be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. Acceleration can be non zero only if there is a net external force on the body. Two kinds of situations are encountered in the application of this law in practice. In some examples, we know that the net external force on the object is zero. In that case we can conclude that the acceleration of the object is zero. For example, a spaceship out in interstellar space, far from all other objects and with all its rockets turned off, has no net external force acting on it. Its acceleration, according to the first law, must be zero. If it is in motion, it must continue to move with a uniform velocity. 2019-20",0

All bryophytes represent this pattern. The diploid sporophyte is represented by a dominant, independent, photosynthetic, vascular plant body. It alternates with multicellular, saprophytic/autotrophic, independent but short-lived haploid gametophyte. Such a pattern is known as haplo-diplontic life cycle. All pteridophytes exhibit this pattern (Figure 3.7 c). Interestingly, while most algal genera are haplontic, some of them such as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic. Fucus, an alga is diplontic. SUMMARY Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms.

1409,1019,"REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS terrestrial species of angiosperms, structures such as runners, rhizomes, suckers, tubers, offsets, etc., are capable of giving rise to new offspring. This method of asexual reproduction is generally referred to as vegetative propagation. Sexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of gametes. It is a complex and slower process as compared to asexual reproduction. Most of the higher animals reproduce almost entirely by sexual method. Events of sexual reproduction may be categorised into pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and post-fertﬂisation events. Pre-fertilisation events include gametogenesis and gamete transfer while post-fertilisation events include the formation of zygote and embryogenesis. Organisms may be bisexual or unisexual. Sexuality in plants is varied, particularly in angiosperms, due to the production of diverse types of ﬂowers. Plants are defined as monoecious and dioecious. Flowers may be bisexual or unisexual ﬂowers. Gametes are haploid in nature and usually a direct product of meiotic division except in haploid organisms where gametes are formed by mitosis. Transfer of male gametes is an essential event in sexual reproduction. It is relatively easy in bisexual organisms. In unisexual animals it occurs by copulation or simultaneous release. In angiosperms, a special process called pollination ensures transfer of pollen grains which carry the pollen grains to the stigma. Syngamy (fertilisation) occurs between the male and female gametes. Syngamy may occur either externally, outside the body of organisms or internally, inside the body. Syngamy leads to formation of a specialised cell called zygote. The process of development of embryo from the zygote is called embryogenesis. In animals, the zygote starts developing soon after its formation. Animals may be either oviparous or viviparous. Embryonal protection and care are better in viviparous organisms. In ﬂowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules mature into seeds.

The overall dimensions of a nucleus are much smaller than those of an atom. Experiments on scattering of a-particles demonstrated that the radius of a nucleus was smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of about 1 04. This means the volume of a nucleus is about 10‘12 times the volume of the atom. In other words, an atom is almost empty. If an atom is enlarged to the size of a classroom, the nucleus would be of the size of pinhead. Nevertheless, the nucleus contains most (more than 99.9%) of the mass of an atom. Does the nucleus have a structure, just as the atom does? If so, what are the constituents of the nucleus? How are these held together? In this chapter, we shall look for answers to such questions. We shall discuss various properties of nuclei such as their size, mass and stability, and also associated nuclear phenomena such as radioactivity, ﬁssion and fusion. 13.2 ATOMIC MASSES AND COMPOSITION OF NUCLEUS The mass of an atom is very small, compared to a kilogram; for example, the mass of a carbon atom, 12C, is 1.992647 X 10‘26 kg.

A simple experiment, called girdling, was used to identify the tissues through which food is transported. On the trunk of a tree a ring of bark up to a depth of the phloem layer, can be carefully removed. In the absence of downward movement of food the portion of the bark above the ring on the stem becomes swollen after a few weeks. This simple experiment shows that phloem is the tissue responsible for translocation of food; and that transport takes place in one direction, i.e., towards the roots. This experiment can be performed by you easily. SUMMARY Plants obtain a variety of inorganic elements (ions) and salts from their surroundings especially from water and soil. The movement of these nutrients from environment into the plant as well as from one plant cell to another plant cell essentially involves movement across a cell membrane. Transport across cell membrane can be through diffusion, facilitated transport or active transport. Water and minerals absorbed by roots are transported by xylem and the organic material synthesised in the leaves 1s transported to other parts of plant through phloem.

The absorption of water by seeds and drywood takes place by a special type of diffusion called imbibition. In higher plants, there is a vascular system comprising of xylem and phloem, responsible for translocation. Water minerals and food cannot be moved within the body of a plant by diffusion alone. They are therefore, transported by a mass ﬂow system — movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. Water absorbed by root hairs moves into the root tissue by two distinct pathways, i.e., apoplast and symplast.

These are bonded together by interatomic or intermolecular forces and stay in a stable equilibrium position. When a solid is deformed, the atoms or molecules are displaced from their equilibrium positions causing a change in the interatomic (or intermolecular) distances. When the deforming force is removed, the interatomic forces tend to drive them back to their original positions. Thus the body regains its original shape and size. The restoring mechanism can be visualised by taking a model of spring-ball system shown in the Fig. 9.1. Here the balls represent atoms and springs represent interatomic forces. \)))))))))))))))))))) V V V s v .‘-’ Iv( ))I Fig. 9. 1 Spring-ball model for the illustration of elastic behaviour of solids. If you try to displace any ball from its equilibrium position, the spring system tries to restore the ball back to its original position. Thus elastic behaviour of solids can be explained in terms of microscopic nature of the solid. Robert Hooke, an English physicist (1635 - 1703 AD) performed experiments on springs and found that the elongation (change in the length) produced in a body is proportional to the applied force or load. In 167 6, he presented his law of 2019-20 elasticity, now called Hooke’s law. We shall study about it in Section 9.4. This law, like Boyle’s law, is one of the earliest quantitative relationships in science. It is very important to know the behaviour of the materials under various kinds of load from the context of engineering design. 9.3 STRESS AND STRAIN When forces are applied on a body in such a manner that the body is still in static equilibrium, it is deformed to a small or large extent depending upon the nature of the material of the body and the magnitude of the deforming force. The deformation may not be noticeable visually in many materials but it is there. When a body is subjected to a deforming force, a restoring force is developed in the body. This restoring force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the applied force. The restoring force per unit area is known as stress. IfFis the force applied normal to the cross—section and A is the area of cross section of the body, Magnitude of the stress = F/A (9.1) The SI unit of stress is N m‘2 or pascal (Pa) and its dimensional formula is [ ML‘I’I“2 ]. There are three ways in which a solid may change its dimensions when an external force acts on it. These are shown in Fig. 9.2. In Fig.9.2(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal forces applied normal to its cross-sectional area. The restoring force per unit area in this case is called tensile stress. If the cylinder is compressed under the action of applied forces, the restoring force per unit area is known as compressive stress. Tensile or compressive stress can also be termed as longitudinal stress. In both the cases, there is a change in the length of the cylinder. The change in the length AL to the original length L of the body (cylinder in this case) is known as longitudinal strain. AL Longitudinal strain = T (9.2) However, if two equal and opposite deforming forces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 9.2(b), there is relative displacement between the opposite faces of the cylinder. The restoring force per unit area developed due to the applied tangential force is known as tangential or shearing stress.",0

(2.15), potential on the dipole axis (0 = O, at ) is given by 1 v::4n€0 £2 (2.16) (Positive sign for 0 = 0, negative sign for 0 = at.) The potential in the equatorial plane (0 = TC / 2) is zero. The important contrasting features of electric potential of a dipole from that due to a single charge are clear from Eqs. (2.8) and (2.15): (i) The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on the angle between the position vector 1' and the dipole moment vector p. (It is, however, axially symmetric about p. That is, if you rotate the position vector r about p, keeping 0 fixed, the points corresponding to P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P.) (ii) The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1 / r2, not as 1 / r, characteristic of the potential due to a single charge. (You can refer to the Fig. 2.5 for graphs of 1/r2 versus r and 1/r versus r, drawn there in another context.) 2.5 POTENTIAL DUE TO A SYSTEM OF CHARGES Consider a system of charges q1, q2,..., qn with position vectors r1, r2,..., rn relative to some origin (Fig. 2.6).

1416,301,"of a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be changed). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric ﬁeld, qE, which can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus can transfer energy in addition to momentum.] We shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. First consider the case of v perpendicular to B. The perpendicular force, q v X B, acts as a centripetal force and produces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The particle will describe a circle if v and B are perpendicular x x x x to each other (Fig. 4.5). If velocity has a component along B, this component remains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic ﬁeld will not be aifected by the magnetic ﬁeld. The motion in a plane perpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing a helical motion (Fig. 4.6). You have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI, Chapter 4) that if r is the radius of the circular path of a particle, then a force of m U2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards the centre of the circle, and is called the centripetal force. If the velocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field B, the magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B and acts like a centripetal force. It has a magnitude q u B. Equating the two expressions for centripetal force, FIGURE 4.5 Circular motion m v2/r= q u B, which gives radius r = m U / qB (4.5) FIGURE 4.6 Helical motion for the radius of the circle described by the charged particle.

So, a) = 2n v= qB/ m [4.6(a)] which is independent of the velocity or energy . Here v is the frequency of rotation. The independence of v from energy has important application in the design of a cyclotron (see Section 4.4.2). The time taken for one revolution is T: 27t/a) E l /v. If there is a component of the velocity parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld (denoted by u”), it will make the particle move along the ﬁeld and the path of the particle would be a helical one (Fig. 4.6). The distance moved along the magnetic field in one rotation is called pitch p. Using Eq. [4.6 (a)], we have p= UHT = 21tm v” / qB [4.6(b)] 138 The radius of the circular component of motion is called the radius of the helix. 2019-20",0

Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of characters that Mendel studied. The ratio of 9:3:3: 1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow: 1 green, with 3 round : 1 wrinkled. This derivation can be written as follows: (3 Round : 1 Wrinkled) (3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9 Round, Yellow : 3 Wrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round, Green : 1 Wrinkled, Green Based upon such observations on dihybrid crosses (crosses between plants differing in two traits) Mendel proposed a second set of generalisations that we call Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment. The law states that ‘when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters’. The Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the independent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis and the production of eggs and pollen in the F1 RrYy plant. Consider the segregation of one pair of genes R and r. Fifty per cent of the gametes have the gene R and the other 50 per cent have r. Now besides each gamete having either R or r, it should also have the allele Y or y. The important thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent R and 50 per cent r is independent from the segregation of 50 per cent Y and 50 per cent y. Therefore, 50 per cent of the r bearing gametes has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Similarly, 50 per cent of the R bearing gametes has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Thus there are four genotypes of gametes (four types of pollen and four types of eggs). The four types are RY, Ry, rYand ry each with a frequency of 25 per cent or 1 /4th of the total gametes produced. When you write down the four types of eggs and pollen on the two sides of a Punnett square it is very easy to derive the composition of the zygotes that give rise to the F2 plants (Figure 5.7). Although there are 1 6 squares how many different types of genotypes and phenotypes are formed? Note them down in the format given.

1418,656,"Magnetism and Moﬁer The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On account of the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation is seen. In the presence of an external field BO, which is strong enough, and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be made to align and point in the same direction as BO. Figure 5.12(b) shows a bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external ﬁeld. The ﬁeld lines gets concentrated inside the material, and the ﬁeld inside is enhanced. In most cases, as is evident from Table 5.2, this enhancement is slight, being one part in 105. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld, the bar will tend to move from weak ﬁeld to strong. Some paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium, oxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. Experimentally, one ﬁnds that the magnetisation of a paramagnetic material is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature T, BO M_c7: w2mw or equivalently, using Eqs. (5.12) and (5.17) __& z _ C T [5.20031] This is known as Curie ’3 law, after its discoverer Pieree Curie (1859- 1906). The constant C is called Curie ’s constant. Thus, for a paramagnetic material both x and ,ur depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value Ms, at which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the ﬁeld. Beyond this, Curie’s law [Eq. (5.20)] is no longer valid. 5.6.3 Ferromagnetism Ferromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld. They have strong tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic ﬁeld to strong magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., they get strongly attracted to a magnet. The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called domain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a net magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains about 1011 atoms. In the ﬁrst instant, the magnetisation varies randomly from domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown in Fig. 5. 13(a). When we apply an external magnetic ﬁeld BO, the domains orient themselves in the direction of B0 and simultaneously the domain oriented in the direction of B0 grow in size. This existence of domains and their motion in B0 are not speculations.

1420,929,"HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE cancer and a large number of them die from it annually. The mechanisms that underlie development of cancer or oncogenic transformation of cells, its treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of research in biology and medicine. In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and regulated. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory mechanisms. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by virtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth. Cancer cells appears to have lost this property. As a result of this, cancerous cells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors. Tumors are of two types: benign and malignant. Benign tumors normally remain conﬁned to their original location and do not spread to other parts of the body and cause little damage. The malignant tumors, on the other hand are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor cells. These cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the surrounding normal tissues. As these cells actively divide and grow they also starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed from such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This property called metastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors. Causes of cancer : Transformation of normal cells into cancerous neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents. These agents are called carcinogens. Ionising radiations like X—rays and gamma rays and non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage leading to neoplastic transformation. The chemical carcinogens present in tobacco smoke have been identiﬁed as a major cause of lung cancer. Cancer causing viruses called oncogenic viruses have genes called viral oncogenes. Furthermore, several genes called cellular oncogenes (c-onc) or proto oncogenes have been identiﬁed in normal cells which, when activated under certain conditions, could lead to oncogenic transformation of the cells. Cancer detection and diagnosis : Early detection of cancers is essential as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases. Cancer detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue and blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts in the case of leukemias. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue cut into thin sections is stained and examined under microscope (histopathological studies) by a pathologist. Techniques like radiography (use of X—rays), CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are very useful to detect cancers of the internal organs. Computed tomography uses X—rays to generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object. MRI uses strong magnetic ﬁelds and non-ionising radiations to accurately detect pathological and physiological changes in the living tissue. Antibodies against cancer-specific antigens are also used for detection of certain cancers. Techniques of molecular biology can be 2019-2020 157",1

(1.3) are relevant: 12 Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive or negative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both negative), F21 is along i' 21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for like charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along — ?21(= ?12 , which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.603)].

1424,1169,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS a group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also generally considered a population for the purpose of ecological studies. All the cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a pond, are some examples of a population. In earlier chapters you have learnt that although an individual organism is the one that has to cope with a changed environment, it is at the population level that natural selection operates to evolve the desired traits. Population ecology is, therefore, an important area because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution. A population has certain attributes whereas, an individual organism does not. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates. In a population these rates refer to per capita births and deaths. The rates, hence, expressed are change in numbers (increase or decrease) with respect to members of the population. Here is an example. If in a pond there were 20 lotus plants last year and through reproduction 8 new plants are added, taking the current population to 28, we calculate the birth rate as 8/20 = 0.4 offspring per lotus per year. If 4 individuals in a laboratory population of 40 fruitﬂies died during a speciﬁed time interval, say a week, the death rate in the population during that period is 4/40 = 0.1 individuals per fruitﬂy per week. Another attribute characteristic of a population is sex ratio. An individual is either a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio (e. g., 60 per cent of the population are females and 40 per cent males). A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages. If the age distribution (per cent individuals of a given age or age group) is plotted for the population, the resulting structure is called an age pyramid (Figure 13.4). For human population, the age pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in a diagram. The shape of the pyramids reﬂects the growth status of the population - (a) whether it is growing, (b) stable or (c) declining.

The transmitted polarisation is the component parallel to the polaroid axis. The double arrows show the oscillations of the electric vector. The above experiment can be easily understood by assuming that light passing through the polaroid P2 gets polarised along the pass-axis of P2. If the pass-axis of P2 makes an angle 0 with the pass-axis of P1, then when the polarised beam passes through the polaroid P2, the component E cos 0 (along the pass-axis of P2) will pass through P2. Thus, as we rotate the polaroid P1 (or P2), the intensity will vary as: 1= 10 cos26 (10.35) where I0 is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through P1. This is known as Malus’ law. The above discussion shows that the intensity coming out of a single polaroid is half of the incident intensity. By putting a second polaroid, the intensity can be further controlled from 50% to zero of the incident intensity by adjusting the angle between the pass-axes of two polaroids. Polaroids can be used to control the intensity, in sunglasses, windowpanes, etc. Polaroids are also used in photographic cameras and 3D movie cameras.

1430,1291,"MICROBES IN HUMAN WELFARE In chapter 8, you have read that microbes cause a large number of diseases in human beings. They also cause diseases in animals and plants. But this should not make you think that all microbes are harmful; several microbes are useful to man in diverse ways. Some of the most important contributions of microbes to human welfare are discussed in this chapter. 10.1 MICROBES IN HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS You would be surprised to know that we use microbes or products derived from them everyday. A common example is the production of curd from milk. Micro-organisms such as Lactobacillus and others commonly called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it to curd. During growth, the LAB produce acids that coagulate and partially digest the milk proteins. A small amount of curd added to the fresh milk as inoculum or starter contain millions of LAB, which at suitable temperatures multiply, thus converting milk to curd, which also improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B12. In our stomach too, the LAB play very beneﬁcial role in checking disease- causing microbes. The dough, which is used for making foods such as dosa and idli is also fermented by bacteria. The puffed-up appearance of dough is due to the production of CO2 gas. Can you tell which metabolic pathway is taking place resulting in the formation of C02? Where do you think the bacteria for these fermentations come from? Similarly the dough, which is used for making bread, is fermented using baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). A number of traditional drinks and foods are also made by fermentation by the microbes. ‘Toddy’, a traditional drink of some parts of southern India is made by fermenting sap from palms. Microbes are also used to ferment ﬁsh, soyabean and bamboo- shoots to make foods. Cheese, is one of the oldest food items in which microbes were used. Different varieties of cheese are known by their characteristic texture, ﬂavour and taste, the speciﬁcity coming from the microbes used. For example, the large holes in ‘Swiss cheese’ are due to production of a large amount of CO2 by a bacterium named Propionibacterium sharmanii. The ‘Roquefort cheese’ are ripened by growing a speciﬁc fungi on them, which gives them a particular ﬂavour. 10.2 MICROBES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS Even in industry, microbes are used to synthesise a number of products valuable to human beings. Beverages and antibiotics are some examples. Production on an industrial scale, requires growing microbes in very large vessels called fermentors (Figure 10.4). 2019—2020",1
1431,878,"188 BIOLOGY The transpiration driven ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on the following physical properties of water: ° Cohesion — mutual attraction between water molecules. ° Adhesion — attraction of water molecules to polar surfaces (such as the surface of tracheary elements). ° Surface Tension — water molecules are attracted to each other in the liquid phase more than to water in the gas phase. These properties give water high tensile strength, i.e., an ability to resist a pulling force, and high capillarity, i.e., the ability to rise in thin tubes. In plants capillarity is aided by the small diameter of the tracheary elements — the tracheids and vessel elements. The process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem vessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water. But what force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf parenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through the stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it results in pulling of water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the xylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular spaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a ‘pull’ (Figure 1 1.9). Measurements reveal that the forces generated by transpiration can create pressures sufﬁcient to lift a xylem sized column of water over 130 metres high. Palisade Stomatal Guard Cell pore Diffusion into surrounding air Figure11.9 Water movement in the leaf. Evaporation from the leaf sets up a pressure gradient between the outside air and the air spaces of the leaf.

1434,142,"Roy Optics and Optical Instruments 9.7. 1 The rainbow The rainbow is an example of the dispersion of sunlight by the water drops in the atmosphere. This is a phenomenon due to combined effect of dispersion, refraction and reﬂection of sunlight by spherical water droplets of rain. The conditions for observing a rainbow are that the Sun should be shining in one part of the sky (say near western horizon) while it is raining in the opposite part of the sky (say eastern horizon). An observer can therefore see a rainbow only when his back is towards the Sun. In order to understand the formation of rainbows, consider Fig. 9.25(a). Sunlight is first refracted as it enters a raindrop, which causes the different wavelengths (colours) of white light to separate. Longer wangelength of light (red) are bent the least while the shorter wavelength (violet) are bent the most. Next, these component rays strike the inner surface of the water drop and get internally reﬂected if the angle between the refracted ray and normal to the drop surface is greater then the critical angle (48° in this case). The reﬂected light is refracted again when it comes out of the drop, as shown in the figure. It is found that the violet light emerges at an angle of 40° related to the incoming sunlight and red light emerges at an angle of 42°. For other colours, angles lie in between these two values. Figure 9.25(b) explains the formation of primary rainbow. We see that red light from drop 1 and violet light from drop 2 reach the observer’s eye. The violet from drop 1 and red light from drop 2 are directed at level above or below the observer. Thus the observer sees a rainbow with red colour on the top and violet on the bottom. The primary rainbow is a result of three-step process, that is, refraction, reﬂection and refraction. smoqugm ;o uoneuuog LL11L|'SM()([/>|l‘l'OD'SDudOlP'MMM/ﬂduq SMoqugBJ/npa'mon‘oa'MMM//:d11L| (it: 333 2019-20",0

The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator. The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deﬂection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it. At the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensiﬁed. That is the reason why tropical cyclones are not formed near the equator. Pressure and Wind The velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of the wind generating forces. The winds in the upper atmosphere, 2 - 3 km above the surface, are free from frictional effect of the surface and are controlled mainly by the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. When isobars are straight and when there is no friction, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis force and the resultant wind blows parallel to the isobar.

Generally, over low pressure area the air will converge and rise. Over high pressure area the air will subside from above and diverge at the surface (Figure 1 0.5).

During the last few decades, the city has expanded to accommodate several satellite towns, which have their own centres. The city has wide-open spaces and many parks and gardens. Types of Urban Settlements Depending on the size and the services available and functions rendered, urban centres are designated as town, city, million city, conurbation, megalopolis. Town The concept of ‘town’ can best be understood with reference to ‘village’. Population size is not the only criterion. Functional contrasts between towns and villages may not always be clear- cut, but specific functions such as, manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, and professional services exist in towns. City A city may be regarded as a leading town, which has outstripped its local or regional rivals. In the words of Lewis Mumford, “ the city is in fact the physical form of the highest and most complex type of associative life”. Cities are much larger than towns and have a greater number of economic functions. They tend to have transport terminals, major financial institutions and regional administrative offices. When the population crosses the one million mark it is designated as a million city. Conurbation The term conurbation was coined by Patrick Geddes in 19 15 and applied to a large area of urban development that resulted from the merging of originally separate towns or cities.

(ii) Bioprocess engineering: Maintenance of sterile (microbial contamination-free) ambience in chemical engineering processes to enable growth of only the desired microbe / eukaryotic cell in large quantities for the manufacture of biotechnological products like antibiotics, vaccines, enzymes, etc. Let us now understand the conceptual development of the principles of genetic engineering. You probably appreciate the advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction. The former provides opportunities for variations and formulation of unique combinations of genetic setup, some of which may be beneﬁcial to the organism as well as the population. Asexual reproduction preserves the genetic information, while sexual reproduction permits variation. Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and animal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of undesirable genes along with the desired genes. The techniques of genetic engineering which include creation of recombinant DNA, use of gene cloning and gene transfer, overcome this limitation and allows us to isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes into the target organism. Do you know the likely fate of a piece of DNA, which is somehow transferred into an alien organism? Most likely, this piece of DNA would not be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But, when it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply and be inherited along with the host DNA. This is because the alien piece of DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to replicate. In a chromosome there is a speciﬁc DNA sequence called the origin of replication, which is responsible for initiating replication. Therefore, for the multiplication of any alien piece of DNA in an organism it needs to be a part of a chromosome(s) which has a speciﬁc sequence known as ‘origin of replication’. Thus, an alien DNA is linked with the origin of replication, so that, this alien piece of DNA can replicate and multiply itself in the host organism. This can also be called as cloning or making multiple identical copies of any template DNA. Let us now focus on the ﬁrst instance of the construction of an artiﬁcial recombinant DNA molecule. The construction of the ﬁrst recombinant DNA emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding antibiotic resistance with a native plasmid (autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA) of Salmonella typhimurium. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic resistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA at speciﬁc locations became possible with the discovery of the so-called 2019-2020",1
1440,138,"Nuclei The composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily explained. The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same number of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons. Deuterium, 2H, which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton and one neutron. Its other isotope tritium, 3H , contains one proton and two neutrons. The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from A = 1 73 to A = 204. We have already mentioned that chemical properties of elements depend on their electronic structure. As the atoms of isotopes have identical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and are placed in the same location in the periodic table. All nuclides with same mass number A are called isobars. For example, the nuclides f’H and 3He are isobars. Nuclides with same neutron number N but different atomic number Z, for example 1;? Hg and 1397 Au, are called isotones. 13.3 SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS As we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who postulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus. At Rutherford’s suggestion, Geiger and Marsden performed their classic experiment: on the scattering of a-particles from thin gold foils. Their experiments revealed that the distance of closest approach to a gold nucleus of an a-particle of kinetic energy 5.5 MeV is about 4.0 X 10‘14 m. The scattering of a-particle by the gold sheet could be understood by Rutherford by assuming that the coulomb repulsive force was solely responsible for scattering. Since the positive charge is confined to the nucleus, the actual size of the nucleus has to be less than 4.0 X 10—14m. If we use a—particles of higher energies than 5.5 MeV, the distance of closest approach to the gold nucleus will be smaller and at some point the scattering will begin to be affected by the short range nuclear forces, and differ from Rutherford’s calculations. Rutherford’s calculations are based on pure coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the a- particle and the gold nucleus. From the distance at which deviations set in, nuclear sizes can be inferred. By performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead of OL-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various elements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately measured. It has been found that a nucleus of mass number A has a radius R =R0A1/3 (13.5) where R0 = 1.2 X 10‘15m (=1.2 fm; 1 frn = 10—15m). This means the volume of the nucleus, which is proportional to R3 is proportional to A. Thus the density of nucleus is a constant, independent of A, for all nuclei. Different nuclei are like a drop of liquid of constant density. The density of nuclear matter is approximately 2.3 X 1017 kg m‘3. This density is very large compared to ordinary matter, say water, which is 103 kg m‘3. This is understandable, as we have already seen that most of the atom is empty. Ordinary matter consisting of atoms has a large amount of empty space. 2019-20 441",0

In the hypogynous ﬂower the gynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated below it. The ovary in such ﬂowers is said to be superior, e. g., mustard, china rose and brinj a1. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other parts of the ﬂower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the same level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half inferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous ﬂowers, the margin of thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused with it, the other parts of ﬂower arise above the ovary.

1442,229,"OSCILLATIONS 357 Of course, as expected, if we put b = 0, all equations of a damped oscillator in this section reduce to the corresponding equations of an undamped oscillator. Example 14.10 For the damped oscillator shown in Fig. 14.19. the mass m of the block is 200 g. k = 90 N m‘1 and the damping constant b is 40 g 5’1. Calculate (a) the period of oscillation. (b) time taken for its amplitude of vibrations to drop to half of its initial value. and (c) the time taken for its mechanical energy to drop to half its initial value. Answer (a) We see that km = 90X0.2 = 18 kg N m‘1 = kg2 S'2; therefore . (km = 4.243 kg 8'1, and b = 0.04 kg S'l. Therefore, b is much less than . (km . Hence, the time period Tfrom Eq. (14.34) is given by T227: 3 Vk Zzﬂlﬂ QONmT1 = 0.3s (b) Now, from Eq. (14.33), the time, T for the 1/2’ amplitude to drop to half of its initial value is given by, _ ln(1/2) _ b/2m 1/2 = 0693 x 2 x 200 s 40 = 6.93 s (c) For calculating the time, t1/2, for its mechanical energy to drop to half its initial value we make use of Eq. (14.35). From this equation we have, E(t )/E(O) = exp (—bt1/2/m) 1/2 Or 1/2 = exp (—bt /m) 1/2 ln(1/2) = -(bt /m) 1/2 Or t1/2 2%x200g = 3.46 s This is just half of the decay period for amplitude. This is not surprising, because, according to Eqs. (14.33) and (14.35), energy depends on the square of the amplitude. Notice that there is a factor of 2 in the exponents of the two exponentials. 4 14. 10 FORCED OSCILLATIONS AND RESONANCE When a system (such as a simple pendulum or a block attached to a spring) is displaced from its equilibrium position and released, it oscillates with its natural frequency w, and the oscillations are called free oscillations. All free oscillations eventually die out because of the ever present damping forces. However, an external agency can maintain these oscillations. These are called forced or driven oscillations. We consider the case when the external force is itself periodic, with a frequency cod called the driven frequency. The most important fact of forced periodic oscillations is that the system oscillates not with its natural frequency a), but at the frequency cod of the external agency; the free oscillations die out due to damping. The most familiar example of forced oscillation is when a child in a garden swing periodically presses his feet against the ground (or someone else periodically gives the child a push) to maintain the oscillations. Suppose an external force Ht) of amplitude F0 that varies periodically with time is applied to a damped oscillator. Such a force can be represented as, F(t) = F0 cos wdt (14.36) The motion of a particle under the combined action of a linear restoring force, damping force and a time dependent driving force represented by Eq. (14.36) is given by, ma(t) =—kx(t) — bv(t) +F0 cos wdt (14.37a) Substituting d2x/dt2 for acceleration in Eq. (14.37a) and rearranging it, we get 2019-20",0

Friction, by deﬁnition, is the component of the contact force parallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes impending or actual relative motion between the two surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but relative motion that the frictional force opposes. Consider a box lying in the compartment of a train that is accelerating. If the box is stationary relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along with the train. What forces cause the acceleration of the box? Clearly, the only conceivable force in the horizontal direction is the force of friction. If there were no friction, the ﬂoor of the train would slip by and the box would remain at its initial position due to inertia (and hit the back side of the train). This impending relative motion is opposed by the static friction f8. Static friction provides the same acceleration to the box as that of the train, keeping it stationary relative to the train. b Example 5.7 Determine the maximum acceleration of the train in which a box lying on its ﬂoor will remain stationary. given that the co—efficient of static friction between the box and the train‘s ﬂoor is 0.15.

What is the coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface '? Fig. 5.11 2019-20 Answer The forces acting on a block of mass m at rest on an inclined plane are (i) the weight mg acting vertically downwards (ii) the normal force N of the plane on the block, and (iii) the static frictional force f5 opposing the impending motion. In equilibrium, the resultant of these forces must be zero. Resolving the weight mg along the two directions shown, we have mgsin0=fs, mg cos0 = N As 0 increases, the self-adjusting frictional force f5 increases until at 6 = 0m, fS achieves its maximum value, (f5 )max = us N. Therefore, tan em = us or em = tan’1 us When 0 becomes just a little more than 6m , there is a small net force on the block and it begins to slide.

However, the tallying of the trial balance is not a conclusive proof of the accuracy of the accounts. It only ensures that all debits and the corresponding credits have been properly recorded in the ledger. 6.2.2 To Help in Locating Errors When a trial balance does not tally (that is, the totals of debit and credit columns are not equal), we know that at least one error has occured. The error (or errors) may have occured at one of those stages in the accounting process: (1) totalling of subsidiary books, (2) posting of j ournal entries in the ledger, (3) calculating account balances, (4) carrying account balances to the trial balance, and (5) totalling the trial balance columns. It may be noted that the accounting accuracy is not ensured even if the totals of debit and credit balances are equal because some errors do not affect equality of debits and credits. For example, the book-keeper may debit a correct amount in the wrong account while making the journal entry or in posting a journal entry to the ledger. This error would cause two accounts to have incorrect balances but the trial balance would tally. Another error is to record an equal debit and credit of an incorrect amount. This error would give the two accounts incorrect balances but would not create unequal debits and credits. As a result, the fact that the trial balance has tallied does not imply that all entries in the books of original record (journal, cash book, etc.) have been recorded and posted correctly. However, equal totals do suggest that several types of errors probably have not occured. 6.2.3 To Help in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Trial balance is considered as the connecting link between accounting records and the preparation of financial statements. For preparing a financial statement, one need not refer to the ledger. In fact, the availability of a tallied trial balance is the first step in the preparation of ﬁnancial statements. All revenue and expense accounts appearing in the trial balance are transferred to the trading and profit and loss account and all liabilities, capital and assets accounts are transferred to the balance sheet.

1448,1484,"11092CHI4 CHAPTER he ocean water is dynamic. Its physical I characteristics like temperature, salinity, density and the external forces like of the sun, moon and the winds inﬂuence the movement of ocean water. The horizontal and vertical motions are common in ocean water bodies. The horizontal motion refers to the ocean currents and waves. The vertical motion refers to tides. Ocean currents are the continuous ﬂow of huge amount of water in a definite direction while the waves are the horizontal motion of water. Water moves ahead from one place to another through ocean currents while the water in the waves does not move, but the wave trains move ahead. The vertical motion refers to the rise and fall of water in the oceans and seas. Due to attraction of the sun and the moon, the ocean water is raised up and falls down twice a day. The upwelling of cold water from subsurface and the sinking of surface water are also forms of vertical motion of ocean water. WAVES Waves are actually the energy, not the water as such, which moves across the ocean surface. Water particles only travel in a small circle as a wave passes. Wind provides energy to the waves. Wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on shorelines. The motion of the surface water seldom affects the stagnant deep bottom water of the oceans. As a wave approaches the beach, it slows down. This is due to the friction occurring between the dynamic water and the sea ﬂoor. And, when the depth of water is less than half the MOVEMENTS OF OCEAN WATER wavelength of the wave, the wave breaks. The largest waves are found in the open oceans. Waves continue to grow larger as they move and absorb energy from the wind. Most of the waves are caused by the wind driving against water. When a breeze of two knots or less blows over calm water, small ripples form and grow as the wind speed increases until white caps appear in the breaking waves. Waves may travel thousands of km before rolling ashore, breaking and dissolving as surf. A wave’s size and shape reveal its origin. Steep waves are fairly young ones and are probably formed by local wind. Slow and steady waves originate from far away places, possibly from another hemisphere. The maximum wave height is determined by the strength of the wind, i.e. how long it blows and the area over which it blows in a single direction. Waves travel because wind pushes the water body in its course while gravity pulls the crests of the waves downward.

This applies equally well if instead of a junction of several lines, we consider a point in a line. The proof of this rule follows from the fact that when currents are steady, there is no accumulation of charges at any junction or at any point in a line. Thus, the total current ﬂowing in, (which is the rate at which charge ﬂows into the j unction), must equal the total current ﬂowing out. that will also be II.

The intermolecular distances are such that it is attracted to all the surrounding molecules [Fig. 10.16(a)]. This attraction results in a negative potential energy for the molecule, which depends on the number and distribution of molecules around the chosen one. But the average potential energy of all the molecules is the same. This is supported by the fact that to take a collection of such molecules (the liquid) (at) 0?) terms of this fact. What is the energy required for having a molecule at the surface? As mentioned above, roughly it is half the energy required to remove it entirely from the liquid i.e., half the heat of evaporation. Finally, what is a surface? Since a liquid consists of molecules moving about, there cannot be a perfectly sharp surface. The density of the liquid molecules drops rapidly to zero around 2 = O as we move along the direction indicated Fig 10.16 (c) in a distance of the order of a few molecular sizes.

(c) Balance of attractive (AI and repulsive (R) forces. and to disperse them far away from each other in order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of evaporation required is quite large. For water it is of the order of 40 kJ/mol. Let us consider a molecule near the surface Fig. 10.16(b). Only lower half side of it is surrounded by liquid molecules. There is some negative potential energy due to these, but obviously it is less than that of a molecule in bulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately it is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a liquid surface have some extra energy in comparison to molecules in the interior. A liquid, thus, tends to have the least surface area which external conditions permit. Increasing surface area requires energy.

While treating the topic of projectile motion. we have stated that we assume that the air resistance has no effect on the motion of the projectile. You must understand what the statement really means. Friction, force due to viscosity, air resistance are all dissipative forces. In the presence of any of such forces opposing motion, any object will lose some part of its initial energy and consequently, momentum too. Thus, a projectile that traverses a parabolic path would certainly show deviation from its idealised trajectory in the presence of air resistance. It will not hit the ground with the same speed with which it was projected from it. In the absence of air resistance, the x-component of the velocity remains constant and it is only the y-component that undergoes a continuous change. However. in the presence of air resistance, both of these would get affected. That would mean that the range would be less than the one given by Eq. (4.43). Maximum height attained would also be less than that predicted by Eq. (4.42). Can you then, anticipate the change in the time of ﬂight? In order to avoid air resistance. we will have to perform the experiment in vacuum or under low pressure, which is not easy. When we use a phrase like ‘neglect air resistance’. we imply that the change in parameters such as range. height etc. is much smaller than their values without air resistance. The calculation without air resistance is much simpler than that with air resistance. 4. 1 1 UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION When an object follows a circular path at a constant speed, the motion of the object is called uniform circular motion. The word “uniform” refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant) throughout the motion. Suppose an object is moving with uniform speed 1) in a circle of radius R as shown in Fig. 4. 19. Since the velocity of the object is changing continuously in direction, the object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the magnitude and the direction of this acceleration. 2019-20",0

Most scientists believe chemical evolution, i.e., formation of biomolecules preceded the appearance of the first cellular forms of life. The subsequent events as to what happened to the first form of life is a conjectured story based on Darwinian ideas of organic evolution by natural selection. Diversity of life forms on earth has been changing over millions of years. It is generally believed that variations in a population result in variable fitness. Other phenomena like habitat fragmentation and genetic drift may accentuate these variations leading to appearance of new species and hence evolution. Homologr is accounted for by the idea of branching descent. Study of comparative anatomy, fossils and comparative biochemistry provides evidence for evolution. Among the stories of evolution of individual species, the story of evolution of modern man is most interesting and appears to parallel evolution of human brain and language. EXERCISES 1.

1454,5,"i Physics The derivation of Eqs. (12.1 7) — (12.19) involves the assumption that the electronic orbits are circular, though orbits under inverse square force are, in general elliptical. (Planets move in elliptical orbits under the inverse square gravitational force of the sun.) However, it was shown by the German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld (1868 — 195 1) that, when the restriction of circular orbit is relaxed, these equations continue to hold even for elliptic orbits. ORBIT VS STATE (ORBITAL PICTURE) OF ELECTRON IN ATOM We are introduced to the Bohr Model of atom one time or the other in the course of physics. This model has its place in the history of quantum mechanics and particularly in explaining the structure of an atom. It has become a milestone since Bohr introduced the revolutionary idea of definite energy orbits for the electrons, contrary to the classical picture requiring an accelerating particle to radiate. Bohr also introduced the idea of quantisation of angular momentum of electrons moving in definite orbits. Thus it was a semi-classical picture of the structure of atom. Now with the development of quantum mechanics, we have a better understanding of the structure of atom. Solutions of the Schrodinger wave equation assign a wave-like description to the electrons bound in an atom due to attractive forces of the protons. An orbit of the electron in the Bohr model is the circular path of motion of an electron around the nucleus. But according to quantum mechanics, we cannot associate a deﬁnite path with the motion of the electrons in an atom. We can only talk about the probability of finding an electron in a certain region of space around the nucleus. This probability can be inferred from the one-electron wave function called the orbital. This function depends only on the coordinates of the electron. It is therefore essential that we understand the subtle differences that em'st in the two models: 0 Bohr model is valid for only one-electron atoms / ions; an energy value, assigned to each orbit, depends on the principal quantum number n in this model. We know that energy associated with a stationary state of an electron depends on n only, for one-electron atoms / ions. For a multi-electron atom / ion, this is not true. 0 The solution of the Schrodinger wave equation, obtained for hydrogen-like atoms / ions, called the wave function, gives information about the probability of ﬁnding an electron in various regions around the nucleus. This orbital has no resemblance whatsoever with the orbit defined for an electron in the Bohr model.

1455,613,"i Physics them. The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays constitutes a beam of light. In this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reﬂection, refraction and dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic laws of reﬂection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by plane and spherical reﬂecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to describe the construction and working of some important optical instruments, including the human eye. PARTICLE MODEL OF LIGHT Newton’s fundamental contributions to mathematics, mechanics, and gravitation often blind us to his deep experimental and theoretical study of light. He made pioneering contributions in the ﬁeld of optics. He further developed the corpuscular model of light proposed by Descartes. It presumes that light energy is concentrated in tiny particles called corpuscles. He further assumed that corpuscles of light were massless elastic particles. With his understanding of mechanics, he could come up with a simple model of reﬂection and refraction. It is a common observation that a ball bouncing from a smooth plane surface obeys the laws of reﬂection. When this is an elastic collision, the magnitude of the velocity remains the same. As the surface is smooth, there is no force acting parallel to the surface, so the component of momentum in this direction also remains the same. Only the component perpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed in reﬂection. Newton argued that smooth surfaces like mirrors reﬂect the corpuscles in a similar manner. In order to explain the phenomena of refraction, Newton postulated that the speed of the corpuscles was greater in water or glass than in air. However, later on it was discovered that the speed of light is less in water or glass than in air. In the field of optics, Newton — the experimenter, was greater than Newton — the theorist. He himself observed many phenomena, which were difficult to understand in terms of particle nature of light. For example, the colours observed due to a thin ﬁlm of oil on water. Property of partial reﬂection of light is yet another such example. Everyone who has looked into the water in a pond sees image of the face in it, but also sees the bottom of the pond. Newton argued that some of the corpuscles, which fall on the water, get reﬂected and some get transmitted. But what property could distinguish these two kinds of corpuscles? Newton had to postulate some kind of unpredictable, chance phenomenon, which decided whether an individual corpuscle would be reﬂected or not. In explaining other phenomena, however, the corpuscles were presumed to behave as if they are identical. Such a dilemma does not occur in the wave picture of light. An incoming wave can be divided into two weaker waves at the boundary between air and water. 9.2 REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS We are familiar with the laws of reﬂection. The angle of reﬂection (i.e., the angle between reﬂected ray and the normal to the reﬂecting surface or the mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle between incident ray and the normal). Also that the incident ray, reﬂected ray and the normal to the reﬂecting surface at the point of incidence lie in the same plane (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid at each point on any reﬂecting surface whether plane or curved. However, we shall restrict our discussion to the 3 1 0 special case of curved surfaces, that is, spherical surfaces. The normal in 2019-20",0

You must have wondered and asked yourself — ‘What is it that makes an organism living, or What is it that an inanimate thing does not have Which a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of life — the cell in all living organisms. All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single cell and are called unicellular organisms While others, like us, composed of many cells, are called multicellular organisms. 8.1 WHAT IS A CELL? Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and (ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete structure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Anton Von Leeuwenhoek ﬁrst saw and described a live cell. Robert Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the structural details of the cell. 8.2 CELL THEORY In 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large number of plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds of cells Which form the tissues of the plant.

Dirac] loved playing with numerical values of Fundamental constants of nature. This led him to an interesting observation. Dirac found that from the basic constants of atomic physics (0, e, mass of electron, mass of proton] and the gravitational constant G, he could arrive at a number with the dimension of time. Further, it was a very large number, its magnitude being close to the present estimate on the age of the universe [~15 billion years]. From the table of fundamental constants in this book, try to see if you too can construct this number [or any other interesting number you can think of ].

1458,472,"200 PHYSICS — POINTS TO PONDER l . In considering motion of an object under the gravitational inﬂuence of another object the following quantities are conserved: (a) Angular momentum (b) Total mechanical energy Linear momentum is not conserved Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler‘s second law. However. it is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force. In Kepler‘s third law [see Eq. [8.1] and T2 = Ks R“. The constant K5 is the same for all planets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [[Eq. (8.38)]. An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the gravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut and the satellite are in “free fall” towards the Earth. . The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance r is given by Gm1m2 r The constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With this choice V = — + constant VLM r This choice implies that V —> 0 as r —> 00. Choosing location of zero of the gravitational energy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that the gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy [which is always positive] and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential energy of the object at inﬁnity is zero]. the gravitational potential energy of an object is negative. The total energy of a satellite is negative. The commonly encountered expression mg h for the potential energy is actually an approximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the point 6, above. Although the gravitational force between two particles is central. the force between two finite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a spherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if the mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central. . The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However. [unlike a metallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside it from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not possible. EXERCISES 8.1 Answer the following : (a) You can shield a charge from electrical forces by putting it inside a hollow conductor. Can you shield a body from the gravitational inﬂuence of nearby matter by putting it inside a hollow sphere or by some other means ? (b) An astronaut inside a small space ship orbiting around the earth cannot detect gravity. If the space station orbiting around the earth has a large size, can he hope to detect gravity ? (c) If you compare the gravitational force on the earth due to the sun to that due to the moon, you would find that the Sun’s pull is greater than the moon’s pull. [you can check this yourself using the data available in the succeeding exercises). However, the tidal effect of the moon’s pull is greater than the tidal effect of sun. Why ? 2019-20",0

We have Mass of 8 neutrons = 8 X 1.00866 u Mass of 8 protons = 8 X 1.00727 u Mass of 8 electrons = 8 X 0.00055 u Therefore the expected mass of 1SO nucleus = 8 X 2.01593 u = 16.12744 u. The atomic mass of 1860 found from mass spectroscopy experiments is seen to be 15.99493 u. Substracting the mass of 8 electrons (8 X 0.00055 u) from this, we get the experimental mass of ISO nucleus to be 1 5.99053 u. Thus, we find that the mass of the ISO nucleus is less than the total mass of its constituents by 0.1 369 1u. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents, AM, is called the mass defect, and is given by AM=[Zmp+(A—Z)mn]—M (13.7) What is the meaning of the mass defect? It is here that Einstein’s equivalence of mass and energy plays a role. Since the mass of the oxygen nucleus is less that the sum of the masses of its constituents (8 protons and 8 neutrons, in the unbound state), the equivalent energy of the oxygen nucleus is less than that of the sum of the equivalent energies of its constituents. If one wants to break the oxygen nucleus into 8 protons and 8 neutrons, this extra energy AM c2, has to supplied. This energy required Eb is related to the mass defect by Eb=AMc2 (13.8) Example 13.3 Find the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit, first in Joules and then in MeV. Using this, express the mass defect of 1860 in MeV/c2.

1463,862,"14 BIOLOGY Flora, manuals, monographs and catalogues are some other means of recording descriptions. They also help in correct identiﬁcation. Flora contains the actual account of habitat and distribution of plants of a given area. These provide the index to the plant species found in a particular area. Manuals are useful in providing information for identiﬁcation of names of species found in an area. Monographs contain information on any one taxon. SUMMARY The living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been identiﬁed and described but a large number still remains unknown. The very range of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and morphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living organisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms, biologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identiﬁcation, nomenclature and classiﬁcation of organisms. The branch of knowledge dealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies of various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity. The basics of taxonomy like identiﬁcation, naming and classiﬁcation of organisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on the resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identiﬁed and assigned a correct scientiﬁc/ biological name comprising two words as per the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents / occupies a place or position in the system of classiﬁcation. There are many categories / ranks and are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All the categories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy. Taxonomists have developed a variety of taxonomic aids to facilitate identiﬁcation, naming and classiﬁcation of organisms. These studies are carried out from the actual specimens which are collected from the ﬁeld and preserved as referrals in the form of herbaria, museums and in botanical gardens and zoological parks. It requires special techniques for collection and preservation of specimens in herbaria and museums. Live specimens, on the other hand, of plants and animals, are found in botanical gardens or in zoological parks. Taxonomists also prepare and disseminate information through manuals and monographs for further taxonomic studies. Taxonomic keys are tools that help in identiﬁcation based on characteristics.",1

This is what early Greeks like Hippocrates as well as Indian Ayurveda system of medicine asserted. It was thought that persons with ‘blackbile’ belonged to hot personality and would have fevers. This idea was arrived at by pure reﬂective thought. The discovery of blood circulation by William Harvey using experimental method and the demonstration of normal body temperature in persons with blackbile using thermometer disproved the ‘good humor’ hypothesis of health. In later years, biology stated that mind inﬂuences, through neural system and endocrine system, our immune system and that our immune system maintains our health. Hence, mind and mental state can affect our health. Of course, health is affected by — (i) genetic disorders — deﬁciencies with which a child is born and deﬁciencies / defects which the child inherits from parents from birth; (ii) infections and (iii) life style including food and water we take, rest and exercise we give to our bodies, habits that we have or lack etc. 2019—2020",1

1466,780,"BIOLOGY process and ecological information of organisms are essential and form the basis of modern taxonomic studies. Hence, characterisation, identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation and nomenclature are the processes that are basic to taxonomy. Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been interested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of organisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days, human beings needed to ﬁnd sources for their basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. Hence, the earliest classiﬁcations were based on the ‘uses’ of various organisms. Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more about different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the relationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as systematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word ‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Linnaeus used Systema Naturae as the title of his publication. The scope of systematics was later enlarged to include identiﬁcation, nomenclature and classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary relationships between organisms. 1 .3 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES Classiﬁcation is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps in which each step represents a rank or category. Since the category is a part of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category and all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy. Each category, referred to as a unit of classiﬁcation, in fact, represents a rank and is commonly termed as taxon (pl.: taxa). Taxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example. Insects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like three pairs of jointed legs. It means insects are recognisable concrete objects which can be classiﬁed, and thus were given a rank or category. Can you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groups represent category. Category further denotes rank. Each rank or taxon, in fact, represents a unit of classiﬁcation. These taxonomic groups/ categories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological aggregates. Taxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the development of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division (for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms, including those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the lowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an",1

1468,838,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS a group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also generally considered a population for the purpose of ecological studies. All the cormorants in a wetland, rats in an abandoned dwelling, teakwood trees in a forest tract, bacteria in a culture plate and lotus plants in a pond, are some examples of a population. In earlier chapters you have learnt that although an individual organism is the one that has to cope with a changed environment, it is at the population level that natural selection operates to evolve the desired traits. Population ecology is, therefore, an important area because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution. A population has certain attributes whereas, an individual organism does not. An individual may have births and deaths, but a population has birth rates and death rates. In a population these rates refer to per capita births and deaths. The rates, hence, expressed are change in numbers (increase or decrease) with respect to members of the population. Here is an example. If in a pond there were 20 lotus plants last year and through reproduction 8 new plants are added, taking the current population to 28, we calculate the birth rate as 8/20 = 0.4 offspring per lotus per year. If 4 individuals in a laboratory population of 40 fruitﬂies died during a speciﬁed time interval, say a week, the death rate in the population during that period is 4/40 = 0.1 individuals per fruitﬂy per week. Another attribute characteristic of a population is sex ratio. An individual is either a male or a female but a population has a sex ratio (e. g., 60 per cent of the population are females and 40 per cent males). A population at any given time is composed of individuals of different ages. If the age distribution (per cent individuals of a given age or age group) is plotted for the population, the resulting structure is called an age pyramid (Figure 13.4). For human population, the age pyramids generally show age distribution of males and females in a diagram. The shape of the pyramids reﬂects the growth status of the population - (a) whether it is growing, (b) stable or (c) declining. Post-reproductive Reproductive Pre-reproductive Expanding Declining Figure 13.4 Representation of age pyramids for human population The size of the population tells us a lot about its status in the habitat.

1470,752,"186 P1 [YSICS — Central Forces We know the time rate of change of the angular momentum of a single particle about the origin is ﬂ=r><F dt The angular momentum of the particle is conserved, if the torque 4: : 1- x F due to the force F on it vanishes. This happens either when F is zero or when F is along r. We are interested in forces which satisfy the latter condition. Central forces satisfy this condition. A ‘central’ force is always directed towards or away from a ﬁxed point, i.e., along the position vector of the point of application of the force with respect to the fixed point. [See Figure below.) Further. the magnitude of a central force Fdepends on r, the distance of the point of application of the force from the fixed point; F = FIr). In the motion under a central force the angular momentum is always conserved. Two important results follow from this: [1] The motion of a particle under the central force is always confined to a plane. (2] The position vector of the particle with respect to the centre of the force (i.e. the fixed point] has a constant areal velocity. In other words the position vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times as the particle moves under the inﬂuence of the central force. Try to prove both these results. You may need to know that the areal velocity is given by : dA/dt = 1/2 r 1) sin a. An immediate application of the above discussion can be made to the motion of a planet under the gravitational force of the sun. For convenience the sun may be taken to be so heavy that it is at rest. The gravitational force of the sun on the planet is directed towards the sun. This force also satisfies the requirement F = F(r), since F = G m1m2/ r2 where m1 and m2 are respectively the masses of the planet and the sun and G is the universal constant of gravitation. The two results [I] and [2) described above, therefore, apply to the motion of the planet. In fact, the result [2) is the well—known second law of Kepler. Tr is the trejectory of the particle under the central force. At a position P, the force is directed along 0P, 0 is the centre of the force taken as the origin. In time At, the particle moves from P to P’, are PP’ = As = D At. The tangent PQ at P to the trajectory gives the direction of the velocity at P.

1471,844,"NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION Sense Organs We smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects by eyes. The nose contains mucus-coated receptors which are specialised for receiving the sense of smell and called olfactory receptors. These are made up of olfactory epithelium that consists of three kinds of cells. The neurons of the olfactory epithelium extend from the outside environment directly into a pair of broad bean-sized organs, called olfactory bulb, which are extensions of the brain’s limbic system. Both nose and tongue detect dissolved chemicals. The chemical senses of gustation (taste) and olfactory (smell) are functionally similar and interrelated. The tongue detects tastes through taste buds, containing gustatory receptors. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain integrates the differential input from the taste buds and a complex ﬂavour is perceived. In the following sections, you will be introduced to the structure and functioning of the eye (sensory organ for vision) and the ear (sensory organ for hearing). 21.6.1 Eye Our paired eyes are located in sockets of the skull called orbits. A brief account of structure and functions of the human eye is given in the following sections. 21.6.1.1 Parts of an eye The adult human eye ball is nearly a spherical structure. The wall of the eye ball is composed of three layers (Figure 2 1.6). The 2323;? external layer is composed of a dense connective tissue and is called the sclera. The anterior portion of this layer is called the cornea. The middle layer, choroid, contains many blood vessels and looks bluish in colour. The choroid layer is thin over the posterior two-thirds of the eye ball, but it becomes thick in the anterior part to form the ciliary body.

1472,1105,"PLANT KINGDOM The gymnosperms are heterosporous; they produce haploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds of spores are produced within sporangia that are borne on sporophst which are arranged spirally along an axis to form lax or compact strobili or cones. ’Ihe strobili bearing microsporophylls and microsporangia are called microsporangiate or male strobili. The microspores develop into a male gametophytic generation which is highly reduced and is conﬁned to only a limited number of cells. This reduced gametophyte is called a pollen grain. The development of pollen grains take place within the microsporangia. The cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules or megasporangia are called macrosporangiate or female strobili. The male or female cones or strobili may be borne on the same tree (Pinus). However, in cycas male cones and megasporophst are bome on different trees. The megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one of the cells of the nucellus. The nucellus is protected by envelopes and the composite structure is called an ovule. ’Ihe ovules are borne on megasporophylls which may be clustered to form the female cones. The megaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form four megaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within the megasporangium develops into a multicellular female gametophyte that bears two or more archegonia or female sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyte is also retained within megasporangium. Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in gymnosperms the male and the female gametophytes do not have an independent free-living existence. They remain within the sporangia retained on the sporophytes. ’Ihe pollen grain is released from the microsporangium. They are carried in air currents and come in contact with the opening of the ovules borne on megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying the male gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules and discharge their contents near the mouth of the archegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote develops into an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seeds are not covered. 201 9-2020 39 Long Shoot (C) Figure 3.4 Gymnosperms: (a) Cycas (b) Pinus (c) Ginkgo",1

By using symmetry consideration, we can easily show that the centres of mass of these bodies lie at their geometric centres. dm dm Fig. 7.8 Detemining the CM of a thin rod. 2019-20 Let us consider a thin rod, whose width and breath (in case the cross section of the rod is rectangular) or radius (in case the cross section of the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than its length. Taking the origin to be at the geometric centre of the rod and x—axis to be along the length of the rod, we can say that on account of reﬂection symmetry, for every element dm of the rod at x, there is an element of the same mass dm located at —x (Fig. 7 .8). The net contribution of every such pair to the integral and hence the integral dem itself is zero. From Eq. (7.6), the point for which the integral itself is zero, is the centre of mass. Thus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin rod coincides with its geometric centre. This can be understood on the basis of reﬂection symmetry. The same symmetry argument will apply to homogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even thick rods of circular or rectangular cross section. For all such bodies you will realise that for every element dm at a point (x, y, 2) one can always take an element of the same mass at the point (—x, —y, —z). (In other words, the origin is a point of reﬂection symmetry for these bodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (7.5 a) all are zero. This means that for all the above bodies, their centre of mass coincides with their geometric centre. p Example 7.1 Find the centre of mass of three particles at the vertices of an equilateral triangle.

1475,4,"G RAVITATI ON I 9 7 — India's Leap into Space India started its space programme in 1962 when Indian National Committee for Space Research was set up by the Government of India which was superseded by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. ISRO identiﬁed the role and importance of space technology in nation‘s development and bringing space to the service of the common man. India launched its ﬁrst low orbit satellite Aryabhata in 1975, for which the launch vehicle was provided by the erstwhile Soviet Union. ISRO started employing its indigenous launching vehicle in 1979 by sending Rohini series of satellites into space from its main launch site at Satish Dhawan Space Center. Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The tremendous progress in India’s space programme has made ISRO one of the six largest space agencies in the world. ISRO develops and delivers application specific satellite products and tools for broadcasts. communication. weather forecasts, disaster management tools. Geographic Information System. cartography. navigation. telemedicine, dedicated distance education satellite etc. In order to achieve complete self—reliance in these applications, cost effective and reliable Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle [PSLV) was developed in early 19905. PSLV has thus become a favoured carrier for satellites of various countries, promoting unprecedented international collaboration. In 2001, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle [GSLVj was developed for launching heavier and more demanding Geosynchronous communication satellites. Various research centers and autonomous institutions for remote sensing. astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space research are functioning under the aegis of the Department of Space. Government of India. Success of lunar [Chandrayaan] and inter planetary (Mangalyaan) missions along with other scientiﬁc projects has been landmark achievements of ISRO. Future endeavors of ISRO in— clude human space ﬂight projects, the development of heavy lift launchers. reusable launch vehicles, semi—cryogenic engines, single and two stage to orbit ($810 and TSTO) vehicles. development and use of composite materials for space application etc. In 1984 Rakesh Sharma became the ﬁrst Indian to go into outer space aboard in a USSR spaceship.

Waves used in television broadcast or other forms of communication have much higher frequencies and thus cannot be received beyond the line of sight. A Geostationery satellite, appearing ﬁxed above the broadcasting station can however receive these signals and broadcast them back to a wide area on earth. The INSAT group of satellites sent up by India are one such group of Geostationary satellites widely used for telecommunications in India. Another class of satellites are called the Polar satellites (Fig. 8.1 1). These are low altitude (h z 500 to 800 km) satellites, but they go around the poles of the earth in a north-south direction whereas the earth rotates around its axis in an east-west direction. Since its time period is around 100 minutes it crosses any altitude many times a day. However, since its height h above the earth is about 500-800 km, a camera fixed on it can view only small strips of the earth in one orbit. Adjacent strips are viewed in the next orbit, so that in effect the whole earth can be viewed strip by strip during the entire day. These satellites can view polar and equatorial regions meterology as well as for environmental studies of the earth. 8. 12 WEIGHTLESSNESS Weight of an object is the force with which the earth attracts it. We are conscious of our own weight when we stand on a surface, since the surface exerts a force opposite to our weight to keep us at rest. The same principle holds good when we measure the weight of an object by a spring balance hung from a fixed point e. g. the ceiling. The object would fall down unless it is subject to a force opposite to gravity. This is exactly what the spring exerts on the object. This is because the spring is pulled down a little by the gravitational pull of the object and in turn the spring exerts a force on the object vertically upwards. Now, imagine that the top end of the balance is no longer held fixed to the top ceiling of the room. Both ends of the spring as well as the object move with identical acceleration g. The spring is not stretched and does not exert any upward force on the obj ect which is moving down with acceleration 9 due to gravity. The reading 2019-20",0

In addition to recombination, mutation is another phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA. As you will learn in Chapter 6, one DNA helix runs continuously from one end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form. Therefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/ duplication) of a segment of DNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be located on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal Male aberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells. In addition to the above, mutation also arise due female to change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known as point mutation. A classical example of such a sex unspeciﬁed mutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions of base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations affected individuals (see Chapter 6)' The mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope mating of this discussion, at this level.

This was based on the heritability of certain characteristic features in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel’s work the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of traits in human beings began. Since it is evident that control crosses that can be performed in pea plant or some other organisms, are not possible in case of inheritance of a particular trait provides an alternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family is called the pedigree analysis. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance of a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations. In human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is utilised to trace the inheritance of a speciﬁc trait, abnormality or disease. Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis have been shown in Figure 5.13.

1480,139,"Duol Nature of Radiation and Matter 0 In Einstein’s picture, the basic elementary process involved in photoelectric effect is the absorption of a light quantum by an electron. This process is instantaneous. Thus, whatever may be the intensity i.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area per unit time, photoelectric emission is instantaneous. Low intensity does not mean delay in emission, since the basic elementary process is the same. Intensity only determines how many electrons are able to participate in the elementary process (absorption of a light quantum by a single electron) and, therefore, the photoelectric current. Using Eq. (1 1.1), the photoelectric equation, Eq. (1 1.2), can be written as eV0=hv—¢0; for VZVO or V0: [ﬂy—E (11.4) e e This is an important result. It predicts that the V0 versus v curve is a straight line with slope = (h/ e), independent of the nature of the material. During 1 906- 1 9 1 6, Millikan performed a series of experiments on photoelectric effect, aimed at disproving Einstein’s photoelectric equation. He measured the slope of the straight line obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig. 1 1.5. Using the known value of e, he determined the value of Planck’s constant h. This value was close to the value of Planck’s contant (= 6.626 X 10‘34J s) determined in an entirely different context. In this way, in 1 9 16, Millikan proved the validity of Einstein’s photoelectric equation, instead of disproving it. The successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis of light quanta and the experimental determination of values of hand $0, in agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the acceptance of Einstein’s picture of photoelectric effect. Millikan verified photoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals over a wide range of radiation frequencies. 1 1.7 PARTICLE NATURE OF LIGHT: THE PHOTON Photoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in interaction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of energy, each of energy h v. Is the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle? Einstein arrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be associated with momentum (h v/ c). A definite value of energy as well as momentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated with a particle. This particle was later named photon. The particle-like behaviour of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of AH. Compton (1892-1962) on scattering of X-rays from electrons. In 192 1, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect. In 1923, Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.

The reactor can be shut down by means of rods (made of, for example, cadmium) that have high absorption of neutrons. The coolant transfers heat to a working ﬂuid which in turn may produce stream. The steam drives turbines and generates electricity. Like any power reactor, nuclear reactors generate considerable waste products. But nuclear wastes need special care for treatment since they are radioactive and hazardous. Elaborate safety measures, both for reactor operation as well as handling and reprocessing the spent fuel, are required. These safety measures are a distinguishing feature of the Indian Atomic Energy programme. An appropriate plan is being evolved to study the possibility of converting radioactive waste into less active and short- lived material. 13.7.3 Nuclear fusion — energy generation in stars When two light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus, energy is released, since the larger nucleus is more tightly bound, as seen from the binding energy curve in Fig. 13. 1.

A farmer ploughing the field, a construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however, the word ‘Work’ covers a definite and precise meaning. Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14- 16 hours a day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is thus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’ is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term ‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The word ‘power’ is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In karate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to the meaning of the word ‘power’ used in physics. We shall find that there is at best a loose correlation between the physical definitions and the physiological pictures these terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to develop an understanding of these three physical quantities. Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two vectors. 6.1.1 The Scalar Product We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 4. Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We shall look at the vector product in Chapter 7. Here we take up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A-B (read 2019-20",0
1485,707,"Electric Charges and Fields [This happens even when the light object is not a conductor. The mechanism for how this happens is explained later in Sections 1.10 and 2.1 0.] The centres of the two types of charges are slightly separated. We know that opposite charges attract while similar charges repel. However, the magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges and in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion. As a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are pulled towards the rods. Example 1.1 How can you charge a metal sphere positively Without touching it? Solution Figure 1.5(a) shows an uncharged metallic sphere on an insulating metal stand. Bring a negatively charged rod close to the metallic sphere, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b). As the rod is brought close to the sphere, the free electrons in the sphere move away due to repulsion and start piling up at the farther end. The near end becomes positively charged due to deﬁcit of electrons. This process of charge distribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the metal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting wire. The electrons will ﬂow to the ground while the positive charges at the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of the negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig. 1.5(c). Disconnect the sphere from the ground. The positive charge continues to be held at the near end [Fig. l.5(d)]. Remove the electrified rod. The positive charge will spread uniformly over the sphere as shown in Fig. 1.5(e). FIGURE 1 .5 In this experiment, the metal sphere gets charged by the process of induction and the rod does not lose any of its charge. Similar steps are involved in charging a metal sphere negatively by induction, by bringing a positively charged rod near it. In this case the electrons will ﬂow from the ground to the sphere when the sphere is connected to the ground with a wire. Can you explain why? 2019-20 I ""[ EI’IJWVXEI ’3.

1486,516,"4 2 PHYSICS Now, let us consider the motion of a car that starts from rest at time t= O s from the origin 0 and picks up speed till t = 10 s and thereafter moves with uniform speed till t = 18 s. Then the brakes are applied and the car stops at t= 20 s and x= 296 m. The position-time graph for this case is shown in Fig. 3.3. We shall refer to this graph in our discussion in the following sections. 3.3 AVERAGE VELOCITY AND AVERAGE SPEED When an object is in motion, its position changes with time. But how fast is the position changing with time and in what direction? To describe this, we define the quantity average velocity. Average velocity is defined as the change in position or displacement (Ax) divided by the time intervals (At), in which the displacement occurs : x2 — x1 Ax (31) l): :— tZ—tl At where x2 and x1 are the positions of the object at time t2and t1, respectively. Here the bar over the symbol for velocity is a standard notation used to indicate an average quantity. The SI unit for velocity is m / s or In 8—1, although km h‘1 is used in many everyday applications. Like displacement, average velocity is also a vector quantity. But as explained earlier, for motion in a straight line, the directional aspect of the vector can be taken care of by + and — signs and we do not have to use the vector notation for velocity in this chapter. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 t (s) —+ Fig. 3.4 The average velocity is the slope of line P1P2' 2019-20 Consider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3.

As seen from the plot, the average velocity of the car betweentime t= 5 s and t= 7 sis: x2 —x1 (27.4 — 10.0)m t2 — t1 (7 — 5) s Geometrically, this is the slope of the straight line P1P2 connecting the initial position P1 to the final position P2 as shown in Fig. 3.4. The average velocity can be positive or negative depending upon the sign of the displacement. It is zero if the displacement is zero. Fig. 3.5 shows the x—t graphs for an obj ect, moving with positive velocity (Fig. 3.5a), moving with negative velocity (Fig. 3.5b) and at rest (Fig. 3.5c). 1| 1| T X X 0 0 t_, o _, t—> (a) (b) (C) Fig. 3.5 Position—time graph for an object (a) moving with positive velocity, (b) moving with negative velocity, and (c) at rest. 1 B: =a7ms‘ Average velocity as defined above involves only the displacement of the object. We have seen earlier that the magnitude of displacement may be different from the actual path length. To describe the rate of motion over the actual path, we introduce another quantity called average speed. Average speed is defined as the total path length travelled divided by the total time interval during which the motion has taken place : Total path length Average speed 2 — (32) Total time interval Average speed has obviously the same unit (m s4) as that of velocity. But it does not tell us in what direction an object is moving. Thus, it is always positive (in contrast to the average velocity which can be positive or negative). If the motion of an object is along a straight line and in the same direction, the magnitude of displacement is equal to the total path length. In that case, the magnitude of average velocity",0

In unicellular organisms, all functions like digestion, respiration and reproduction are performed by a single cell. In the complex body of multicellular animals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups of cells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism like Hydra is made of different types of cells and the number of cells in each type can be in thousands. The human body is composed of billions of cells to perform various functions. How do these cells in the body work together? In multicellular animals, a group of similar cells alongwith intercellular substances perform a specific function. Such an organisation is called tissue. You may be surprised to know that all complex animals consist of only four basic types of tissues. These tissues are organised in specific proportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and kidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by their physical and / or chemical interaction, they together form organ system, e.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour and contribute to the survival of the body as a whole. 7. 1 ANIMAL TISSUES The structure of the cells vary according to their function. Therefore, the tissues are different and are broadly classified into four types : (i) Epithelial, (ii) Connective, (iii) Muscular and (iv) Neural. 2019-2020",1

Find out more about it and discuss whether the panic reaction was justified. How can we prevent the spread of the ﬂu in case some chicken are infected? 9. 1.2 Animal Breeding Breeding of animals is an important aspect of animal husbandry. Animal breeding aims at increasing the yield of animals and improving the desirable qualities of the produce. For what kind of characters would we breed animals? Would the selection of characters differ with the choice of animals? What do we understand by the term ‘breed’? A group of animals related by descent and similar in most characters like general appearance, features, size, conﬁguration, etc., are said to belong to a breed. Find out the names of some common breeds of cattle and poultry in the farms of your area. When breeding is between animals of the same breed it is called inbreeding, while crosses between different breeds are called outbreeding. Inbreeding : Inbreeding refers to the mating of more closely related individuals within the same breed for 4- 6 generations. The breeding strategy is as follows — superior males and superior females of the same breed are identiﬁed and mated in pairs. The progeny obtained from such matings are evaluated and superior males and females among them are identiﬁed for further mating. A superior female, in the case of cattle, is the cow or buffalo that produces more milk per lactation. On the other hand, a superior male is the bull, which gives rise to superior progeny as compared to those of other males. Try to recollect the homozygous purelines developed by Mendel as discussed in Chapter 5. A similar strategy is used for developing purelines in cattle as was used in case of peas. Inbreeding increases homozygosity. Thus inbreeding is necessary if we want to evolve a pureline in any animal. Inbreeding exposes harmful recessive genes that are eliminated by selection. It also helps in accumulation of superior genes and elimination of less desirable genes. Therefore, this approach, where there is selection at each step, increases the productivity of inbred population. However, continued inbreeding, especially close inbreeding, usually reduces fertility and even productivity. This is called inbreeding depression. Whenever this becomes a problem, selected animals of the breeding population should be mated 2019-2020 (b) Figure 9.1 Improved breed of cattle and chickens (a) Jersey (b) Leghorn I67",1

(b) A charged particle enters an environment of a strong and non-uniform magnetic field varying from point to point both in magnitude and direction, and comes out of it following a complicated trajectory. Would its final speed equal the initial speed if it suffered no collisions with the environment? (c) An electron travelling west to east enters a chamber having a uniform electrostatic field in north to south direction. Specify the direction in which a uniform magnetic field should be set up to prevent the electron from deﬂecting from its straight line path. An electron emitted by a heated cathode and accelerated through a potential difference of 2.0 kV, enters a region with uniform magnetic field of 0.15 T. Determine the trajectory of the electron if the field (a) is transverse to its initial velocity, (b) makes an angle of 309 with the initial velocity. A magnetic field set up using Helmholtz coils (described in Exercise 4.16) is uniform in a small region and has a magnitude of 0.75 T. In the same region, a uniform electrostatic field is maintained in a direction normal to the common axis of the coils. A narrow beam of (single species) charged particles all accelerated through 15 kV enters this region in a direction perpendicular to both the axis of the coils and the electrostatic field. If the beam remains undeﬂected when the electrostatic field is 9.0 X 10’5 V m'l, make a simple guess as to what the beam contains. Why is the answer not unique? A straight horizontal conducting rod of length 0.45 m and mass 60 g is suspended by two vertical wires at its ends. A current of 5.0 A is set up in the rod through the wires. (a) What magnetic field should be set up normal to the conductor in order that the tension in the wires is zero? (b) What will be the total tension in the wires if the direction of current is reversed keeping the magnetic field same as before? (Ignore the mass of the wires.) g = 9.8 m s’z. The wires which connect the battery of an automobile to its starting motor carry a current of 300 A (for a short time). What is the force per unit length between the wires if they are 70 cm long and 1.5 cm apart? Is the force attractive or repulsive? A uniform magnetic field of 1.5 T exists in a cylindrical region of radius 10.0 cm, its direction parallel to the axis along east to west. A wire carrying current of 7.0 A in the north to south direction passes through this region. What is the magnitude and direction of the force on the wire if, (a) the wire intersects the axis, (b) the wire is turned from N-S to northeast-northwest direction, (c) the wire in the N-S direction is lowered from the axis by a distance of 6.0 cm? A uniform magnetic field of 3000 G is established along the positive z—direction. A rectangular loop of sides 10 cm and 5 cm carries a current of 12 A.

1494,1511,"Accounting for Share Capital 6 3 cumulatively called ‘Unpaid calls’ or ‘Calls in Arrears’. However, it is not mandatory for a company to maintain a separate Calls-in-Arrears Account. There are also instances where some shareholders consider it discreet to pay a part or whole of the amount not yet called-up on the shares allotted to them. Any amount paid by a shareholder in the excess of the amount due from him on allotment/ call (calls) is known as ‘Calls in Advance’ for which a separate account is maintained. A company has the power to charge interest on calls in arrears and is under an obligation to pay interest on calls-in-advance if it accepts them in accordance with the provisions of Articles of Association. Over Subscription: It is possible for the shares of some companies to be over subscribed which means that applications for more shares are received than the number offered for subscription. If the amount of minimum subscription is not received to the extent of 90%, the issue dissolves. In case the applications received are less than the number of shares offered to the public, the issue is termed as ‘under subscribed’. Issue of Shares at Premium: Irrespective of the fact that shares have been issued for consideration other than cash, they can be issued either at par or at premium. The issue of shares at par implies that the shares have been issued for an amount exactly equal to their face or nominal value. In case shares are issued at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares, the amount of premium is credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium Reserve Account’, the use of which is strictly regulated by law. Issue of Shares at Discount: Shares can as well be issued at a discount, i.e. for an amount less than the nominal or par value of shares provided the company fully complies with the provisions laid down by law with regard to the same. Apart from such compliance, shares of a company cannot ordinarily be issued at a discount. According to the Companies Act, 2013, only sweat equity shares can be issued at a discount. When shares are issued at a discount, the amount of discount is debited to ‘Discount on Issue of Share Account’, which is in the nature of capital loss for the company. Forfeiture of Shares: Sometimes, shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments on shares allotted to them. In such a case, the company has the authority to forfeit shares of the defaulters. This is called ‘Forfeiture of Shares’. Forfeiture means the cancellation of allotment due to breach of contract and to treat the amount already received on such shares as forfeited to the company. The precise accounting treatment of share forfeiture depends upon the conditions on which the shares have been issued — at par, premium or discount. Generally speaking, accounting treatment on forfeiture is to reverse the entries passed till the stage of forfeiture, the amount already received on the shares being credited to Forfeiture Shares Account. Reissue of Shares: The management of a company is vested with the power to reissue the shares once forfeited by it, subject of course, to the terms and conditions in the articles of association relating to the same. The shares can be reissued even at a discount provided the amount of discount allowed does not exceed the credit",3

In actual design, the wire is sometimes cut in several pieces placed side by side and connected at the ends by thick metal strip. (Fig. 3.28). In the figure, the wires run from A to C. The small vertical portions are the thick metal strips connecting the various sections of the wire. A current I ﬂows through the wire which can be varied by a variable resistance (rheostat, R) in the circuit.

1497,1187,"234 (ii) BIOLOGY predators. The Monarch butterﬂy is highly distasteful to its predator (bird) because of a special chemical present in its body. Interestingly, the butterﬂy acquires this chemical during its caterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed. For plants, herbivores are the predators. Nearly 25 per cent of all insects are known to be phytophagous (feeding on plant sap and other parts of plants). The problem is particularly severe for plants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their predators. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of morphological and chemical defences against herbivores. Thorns (Acacia, Cactus) are the most common morphological means of defence. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the herbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion, disrupt its reproduction or even kill it. You must have seen the weed Calotropis growing in abandoned fields. The plant produces highly poisonous cardiac glycosides and that is why you never see any cattle or goats browsing on this plant. Awide variety of chemical substances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale (nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc.,) are produced by them actually as defences against grazers and browsers. Competition: When Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and survival of the ﬁttest in nature, he was convinced that interspeciﬁc competition is a potent force in organic evolution. It is generally believed that competition occurs when closely related species compete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not entirely true. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete for the same resource. For instance, in some shallow South American lakes, Visiting ﬂamingoes and resident fishes compete for their common food, the zooplankton in the lake. Secondly, resources need not be limiting for competition to occur; in interference competition, the feeding efﬁciency of one species might be reduced due to the interfering and inhibitory presence of the other species, even if resources (food and space) are abundant. Therefore, competition is best deﬁned as a process in which the ﬁtness of one species (measured in terms of its ‘r’ the intrinsic rate of increase) is signiﬁcantly lower in the presence of another species. It is relatively easy to demonstrate in laboratory experiments, as Gause and other experimental ecologists did, when resources are limited the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate the other species, but evidence for such competitive exclusion occurring in nature is not always conclusive. Strong and persuasive circumstantial evidence does exist however in some cases.

1499,60,"130 PHYSICS An experiment on head-on collision In performing an experiment on collision on a horizontal surface, we face three difﬁculties. One, there will be friction and bodies will not travel with uniform velocities. Two, if two bodies of different sizes collide on a table, it would be difficult to arrange them for a head-on collision unless their centres of mass are at the same height above the surface. Three, it will be fairly difﬁcult to measure velocities of the two bodies just before and just after collision. By performing this experiment in a vertical direction, all the three difficulties vanish. Take two balls, one of which is heavier (basketball / football / volleyball) and the other lighter (tennis ball / rubber ball / table tennis ball). First take only the heavier ball and drop it vertically from some height, say 1 m. Note to which it rises. This gives the velocities near the ﬂoor or ground, just before and just after the bounce (by using 1)2 = 2 gh ). Hence you will get the coefficient of restitution. Now take the big ball and a small ball and hold them in your W hands one over the other, with the heavier ball below the lighter one, as shown here. Drop them together, taking care that they remain together while falling, and see what happens. You will find that the heavier ball rises less than when it was dropped alone, while the lighter one shoots up to about 3 m. With practice, you will be able to hold the ball properly so that the lighter ball rises vertically up and I does not ﬂy sideways. This is head-on collision. You can try to find the best combination of balls which gives you , the best effect. You can measure the masses on a standard balance. We leave it to you to think how you can determine the initial and l final velocities of the balls. _ (m1 —m2) 1 mlm2 2 v _ —v . = _ v _ 1f 11 (6.27) 2 m1 + m2 h m1 + m2 _ 2mlv1i which is a positive quantity as expected. and ”2f _ m1 + m2 (6.28) Consider next an elastic collision.

1509,1140,"168 BIOLOGY 10.4. 1 Meiosis I Prophase I: Prophase of the ﬁrst meiotic division is typically longer and more complex when compared to prophase of mitosis. It has been further subdivided into the following five phases based on chromosomal behaviour, i.e., Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis. During leptotene stage the chromosomes become gradually visible under the light microscope. The compaction of chromosomes continues throughout leptotene. This is followed by the second stage of prophase I called zygotene. During this stage chromosomes start pairing together and this process of association is called synapsis. Such paired chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. Electron micrographs of this stage indicate that chromosome synapsis is accompanied by the formation of complex structure called synaptonemal complex. The complex formed by a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes is called a bivalent or a tetrad. However, these are more clearly visible at the next stage. The first two stages of prophase I are relatively short-lived compared to the next stage that is pachytene. During this stage, the four chromatids of each bivalent chromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appears as tetrads. This stage is characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules, the sites at which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is also an enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is called recombinase. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic material on the two chromosomes. Recombination between homologous chromosomes is completed by the end of pachytene, leaving the chromosomes linked at the sites of crossing over. The beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of the synaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombined homologous chromosomes of the bivalents to separate from each other except at the sites of crossovers. These X—shaped structures, are called chiasmata. In oocytes of some vertebrates, diplotene can last for months or years. The ﬁnal stage of meiotic prophase I is diakinesis. This is marked by terminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the homologous chromosomes for separation. By the end of diakinesis, the nucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope also breaks down. Diakinesis represents transition to metaphase. Metaphase I: The bivalent chromosomes align on the equatorial plate (Figure 10.3). The microtubules from the opposite poles of the spindle attach to the kinetochore of homologous chromosomes.",1

If Vis the voltage across R and I the current through it, then P = VI (3.34) The connecting wires from the power station to the device has a ﬁnite resistance RC. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is wasted is PC with PC: 12 RC P2 R 2 V2 C (3.35) from Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the connecting wires is inversely proportional to V2. The transmission cables from power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance RC is considerable. To reduce PC, these wires carry current at enormous values of Vand this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission lines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas.

For a detailed evaluation of the heart’s function, multiple leads are attached to the chest region. Here, we will talk only about a standard ECG. Each peak in the ECG is identiﬁed with a Figure 18. 3 Diagrammaﬂc presentation of a letter from P to T that corresponds to a speciﬁc standard ECG electrical activity of the heart. The P-wave represents the electrical excitation (or depolarisation) of the atria, which leads to the contraction of both the atria. The QRS complex represents the depolarisation of the ventricles, which initiates the ventricular contraction. The contraction starts shortly after Q and marks the beginning of the systole. The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to normal state (repolarisation). The end of the T-wave marks the end of systole. Obviously, by counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a given time period, one can determine the heart beat rate of an individual. Since the ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same shape for a given lead conﬁguration, any deviation from this shape indicates a possible abnormality or disease. Hence, it is of a great clinical signiﬁcance. 18.4 DOUBLE CIRCULATION The blood ﬂows strictly by a ﬁxed route through Blood Vessels—the arteries and veins. Basically, each artery and vein consists of three layers: an inner lining of squamous endothelium, the tunica intima, a middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres, the tunica media, and an external layer of ﬁbrous connective tissue with collagen ﬁbres, the tunica externa. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins (Figure 1 8.4) . As mentioned earlier, the blood pumped by the right ventricle enters the pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is passed on to the lungs from where the oxygenated blood is carried by the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the pulmonary circulation. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is carried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues from where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules, veins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. This is the systemic circulation (Figure 18.4). The systemic circulation provides nutrients, O2 and other essential substances to the tissues and takes CO2 and other harmful substances away for elimination. A unique vascular connection exists between the digestive tract and liver called",1

Yet, the mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops may not be zero. We will come across such examples in connection with paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment through their net charge is zero. 5.4 THE EARTH’S MAGNETISM Earlier we have referred to the magnetic field of the earth. The strength of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld varies from place to place on the earth’s surface; its value being of the order of 10‘5 T. What causes the earth to have a magnetic ﬁeld is not clear. Originally the magnetic ﬁeld was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet placed approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in the interior. However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct. The magnetic ﬁeld is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced by convective motion of metallic ﬂuids (consisting mostly of molten iron and nickel) in the outer core of the earth. This is known as the dynamo effect. The magnetic ﬁeld lines of the earth resemble that of a (hypothetical) magnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The axis of the dipole does not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently titled by approximately 1 1.3° with respect to the later. In this way of looking at it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic ﬁeld lines due to the dipole enter or leave the earth. The location of the north magnetic pole is at a latitude of 79.74° N and a longitude of 7 1.8° W, a place somewhere in north Canada. The magnetic south pole is at 79.74° S, 108.22° E in the Antarctica. The pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the north magnetic pole. Likewise, the pole near the geographic south pole is called 2019-20 [9 mama /8L’LUOGS/A08'PBOU ' 3p8u 'MMM//:(,lnL| C5 o o E a: (a a to FF _.

During the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinic acid a molecule of GTP is synthesised. This is a substrate level phosphorylation. In a coupled reaction GTP is converted to GDP with the simultaneous synthesis of ATP from ADP. Also there are three points in the cycle where NAD+ is reduced to NADH + H“ and one point Malic acid (50) where FAD’“ is reduced to FADHZ.

The summary equation for this phase of respiration may be written as follows: We have till now seen that glucose has been broken down to release CO2 and eight molecules of NADH + H’“; two of FADH2 have been synthesised besides just two molecules of ATP in TCA cycle. You may be wondering why we have been discussing respiration at all — neither 02 has come into the picture nor the promised large number of ATP has yet been synthesised. Also what is the role of the NADH + H’“ and FADH2 that is synthesised? Let us now understand the role of O2 in respiration and how ATP is synthesised. 14.4.2 Electron Transport System (ETS) and Oxidative Phosphorylation The following steps in the respiratory process are to release and utilise the energy stored in NADH+H+ and FADHZ This is accomplished when they are oxidised through the electron transport system and the electrons are passed on to 02 resulting in the formation of H20. The metabolic pathway through which the electron passes from one carrier to another, is called the electron transport system (ETS) (Figure 14.4) and it is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

This work is stored in the form of potential energy of q. If the point P has position vector r relative to some origin, we can write: Potential energy of q at r in an external ﬁeld = qV(r) (2.27) where V(r) is the external potential at the point r. Thus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6X 10‘19 C is accelerated by a potential difference of AV = 1 volt, it would gain energy of qAV = 1.6 X lO‘ng. This unit of energy is defined as l electron volt or leV, i.e., 1 eV=1.6 X 10‘19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in atomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV= 103eV = 1.6 X 10‘16J , 1 MeV = lOGeV = 1.6 x 10—13;], 1 GeV = lOQeV = 1.6 x 104% and 1 TeV= 1012eV = 1.6 X 10‘7J).

First, we calculate the work done in bringing the charge q1 from infinity to r1. Work done in this step is q1 V(r1), using Eq. (2.27). Next, we consider the work done in bringing q2 to r2. In this step, work is done not only against the external ﬁeld E but also against the field due to ‘11- Work done on q2 against the external ﬁeld = (12 Vtrzl Work done on q2 against the ﬁeld due to q1 : c11q2 41t$0r12 where r12is the distance between q1 and q2.

They represent a great challenge and opportunity for planners. Supply of water to rural settlements in developing countries is not adequate. People in villages, particularly in mountainous and arid areas have to walk long distances to fetch drinking water. Water borne diseases such as cholera and jaundice tend to be a common problem. The countries of South Asia face conditions of drought and ﬂood very often. Crop cultivation sequences, in the absence of irrigation, also suffer. The general absence of toilet and garbage disposal facilities cause health related problems. The design and use of building materials of houses vary from one ecological region to another. The houses made up of mud, wood and thatch, remain susceptible to damage during heavy rains and ﬂoods, and require proper maintenance every year. Most house designs are typically deficient in proper ventilation. Besides, the design of a house includes the animal shed along with its fodder- store within it. This is purposely done to keep the domestic animals and their food properly protected from wild animals. Unmetalled roads and lack of modern communication network creates a unique problem. During rainy season, the settlements remain cut off and pose serious difﬁculties in providing emergency services. It is also difﬁcult to provide adequate health and educational infrastructure for their large rural population. The problem is particularly serious where proper villagisation has not taken place and houses are scattered over a large area. Urban Settlements Rapid urban growth is a recent phenomenon. Until recent times, few settlements reached the population size of more than a few thousand inhabitants. The first urban settlement to reach a population of one million was the city of London by around. AD. 18 10 By 1982 approximately 1 75 cities in the world had crossed the one million population mark. Presently 54 per cent of the world’s population lives in urban settlements compared to only 3 per cent in the year 1800 (Table 10.1). Table 10.1: Percentage of World's Population Living in Urban Areas Classiﬁcation of Urban Settlements The definition of urban areas varies from one country to another. Some of the common basis of classification are size of population, occupational structure and administrative setup. Population Size It is an important criteria used by most countries to define urban areas. The lower limit of the population size for a settlement to be designated as urban is 1,500 in Colombia, 2,000 in Argentina and Portugal, 2,500 in U.S.A. and Thailand, 5,000 in India and 30,000 in Japan. Besides the size of population, density of 400 persons per sq km and share of non-agricultural workers are taken into consideration in India. Countries with low density of population may choose a lower number as the cut-off figure compared to densely populated countries. In Denmark, Sweden and Finland, all places with a population size of 250 persons are called urban. The minimum population for a city is - Fm mm: 3:»:- r r” 4; 2019—20",2

From the geometry of Fig. 14. 1 1, it is clear that the velocity of the projection particle P’ at time t is v(t) = —wA sin (wt + (p) (14.9) Fig. 1 4.1 1 The velocity, v (t), of the particle P’ is the projection of the velocity 6 of the reference particle, P. 2019-20 where the negative sign shows that v (t) has a direction opposite to the positive direction of x—axis. Eq. (14.9) gives the instantaneous velocity of a particle executing SHM, where displacement is given by Eq. (14.4). We can, of course, obtain this equation without using geometrical argument, directly by differentiating (Eq. 14.4) with respect of t: v(t)=%x(t) (14.10) The method of reference circle can be similarly used for obtaining instantaneous acceleration of a particle undergoing SHM. We know that the centripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform circular motion has a magnitude v2/A or cozA, and it is directed towards the centre i.e., the direction is along P0. The instantaneous acceleration of the projection particle P’ is then (See Fig. 14.12) a (t) = —a)2A cos (wt + (1)) = —a)2x(t) (14.11) Fig. 1 4. 1 2 The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P’is the projection of the acceleration a of the reference particle P. Eq. (14.1 1) gives the acceleration of a particle in SHM. The same equation can again be obtained directly by differentiating velocity v(t) given by Eq. (14.9) with respect to time: d =_ (14.12) a(t) dt v(t) We note from Eq. (14.1 1) the important property that acceleration of a particle in SHM is proportional to displacement.

1526,671,"l Physics This wavelength is so small that it is beyond any measurement. This is the reason why macroscopic objects in our daily life do not show wave-like properties. On the other hand, in the sub-atomic domain, the wave character of particles is signiﬁcant and measurable. Consider an electron (mass m, charge e) accelerated from rest through a potential V. The kinetic energy K of the electron equals the work done (eV) on it by the electric ﬁeld: where V is the magnitude of accelerating potential in volts. For a 120 V accelerating potential, Eq. (1 1. 1 1) gives 2. = 0.1 12 nm. This wavelength is of the same order as the spacing between the atomic planes in crystals. This suggests that matter waves associated with an electron could be veriﬁed by crystal diffraction experiments analogous to X-ray diffraction. We describe the experimental veriﬁcation of the de Broglie hypothesis in the next section. In 1929, de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons. The matter—wave picture elegantly incorporated the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. According to the principle, it is not possible to measure both the position and momentum of an electron (or any other particle) at the same time exactly. There is always some uncertainty (A x) in the specification of position and some uncertainty (Ap) in the speciﬁcation of momentum. The product of Axand Ap is of the order of h* (with h = h/Zit), i.e., AxApzh (11.12) Equation (1 1.12) allows the possibility that Axis zero; but then Ap must be inﬁnite in order that the product is non-zero. Similarly, if Ap is zero, Ax must be inﬁnite. Ordinarily, both Ax and Ap are non-zero such that their product is of the order of h.

The ratio of the volume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed in respiration is called the respiratory quotient (R9) or respiratory ratio. The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory substrate used during respiration. When carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completely oxidised, the RQ will be 1, because equal amounts of CO2 and 02 are evolved and consumed, respectively, as shown in the equation below :",1

As over a million species of animals have been described till now, the need for classiﬁcation becomes all the more important. The classification also helps in assigning a systematic position to newly described species. 4. l BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION Inspite of differences in structure and form of different animals, there are fundamental features common to various individuals in relation to the arrangement of cells, body symmetry, nature of coelom, patterns of digestive, circulatory or reproductive systems. These features are used as the basis of animal classification and some of them are discussed here. 4. 1. 1 Levels of Organisation Though all members of Animalia are multicellular, all of them do not exhibit the same pattern of organisation of cells. For example, in sponges, the cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates, i.e., they exhibit cellular level of organisation. Some division of labour (activities) occur among the cells. In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Here the cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence is called tissue level of organisation.

The group Fungi has more species than all the vertebrate species combined. India, with about 45,000 species of plants and twice as many species of animals, is one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world. Species diversity on earth is not uniformly distributed but shows interesting patterns. It is generally highest in the tropics and decreases towards the poles. Important explanations for the species richness of the tropics are: Tropics had more evolutionary time; they provide a relatively constant environment and, they receive more solar energy which contributes to greater productivity. Species richness is also function of the area of a region; the species-area relationship is generally a rectangular hyperbolic function. It is believed that communities with high diversity tend to be less variable, more productive and more resistant to biological invasions. Earth’s fossil history reveals incidence of mass extinctions in the past, but the present rates of extinction, largely attributed to human activities, are 100 to 1000 times higher. Nearly 700 species have become extinct in recent times and more than 15,500 species (of which > 650 are from India) currently face the threat of extinction. The causes of high extinction rates at present include habitat (particularly forests) loss and fragmentation, over-exploitation, biological invasions and c o - extinctions. Earth’s rich biodiversity is vital for the very survival of mankind. The reasons for conserving biodiversity are narrowly utilitarian, broadly utilitarian and ethical. Besides the direct beneﬁts (food, fibre, firewood, pharmaceuticals, etc.), there are many indirect benefits we receive through ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, climate moderation and ﬂood control. We also have a moral responsibility to take good care of earth’s biodiversity and pass it on in good order to our next generation. Biodiversity conservation may be in situ as well as ex situ. In in situ conservation, the endangered species are protected in their natural habitat so that the entire ecosystem is protected. Recently, 34 ‘biodiversity hotspots’ in the world have been proposed for intensive conservation efforts. Of these, three (Western Ghats-Sri Lanka, Himalaya and Indo-Burma) cover India’s rich biodiversity regions. Our country’s in situ conservation efforts are reﬂected in its 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks, > 450 wildlife sanctuaries and many sacred groves. Ex situ conservation methods include protective maintenance of threatened species in zoological parks and botanical gardens, in vitro fertilisation, tissue culture propagation and cryopreservation of gametes.

Equation (2.22) is true for any sign of qland (12. If q1q2 > 0, potential energy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges (q1q2 > O), electrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to be done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite distance apart. For unlike charges (q1 q2 < O), the electrostatic force is attractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this force to take the charges from the given location to inﬁnity. In other words, a negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to the present locations), so the potential energy is negative. Equation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of point charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three charges q1, q2 and q3 located at r1, r2, :3, respectively. To bring q1 first from inﬁnity to r1, no work is required.

(15.34) intereference where the amplitudes subtract out in the resultant wave. Fig. 15.10 shows these two cases of interference of waves arising from the principle of superposition. 15.6 REFLECTION OF WAVES So far we considered waves propagating in an unbounded medium. What happens if a pulse or a wave meets a : "" is the case of destructive “mm reﬂected. The phenomenon of echo is an example of reﬂection by a rigid boundary. If the boundary is not completely rigid or is an interface between two different elastic media, the situation is some what complicated. A part of the incident wave is reﬂected and a part is transmitted into the second medium. If a wave is incident obliquely on the boundary between two different media the transmitted wave is called the refracted wave. The incident and refracted waves obey Snell’s law of refraction, and the incident and reflected waves obey the usual laws of reﬂection. Fig. 15.1 1 shows a pulse travelling along a stretched string and being reﬂected by the boundary. Assuming there is no absorption of energy by the boundary, the reﬂected wave has the same shape as the incident pulse but it suffers a phase change of 7c or 1800 on reﬂection. This is because the boundary is rigid and the disturbance must have zero displacement at all times at the boundary. By the principle of superposition, this is possible only if the reﬂected and incident waves differ by a phase of 7:, so that the resultant displacement is zero. This reasoning is based on boundary condition on a rigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion dynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall, it exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third Law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the string generating a reﬂected pulse that differs by a phase of 7c. ..‘\\\“ .. —> O .l\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ n\\\\\\\‘ u' v v v I v v v v I v v v v v v v v v v ! v v v v f 5 g M“\\\‘ .“‘. ,- W. —> a l I I. \ :.“ I. .h. a l O A‘““““““““““““““““‘“““““V‘ .K“‘\“- a I I Q : 7II.'lI.I'll'l'l'lIIII'I'I'I'll'lllllllll'l'l"" ‘rllllll- § I O ‘ > O \ ""4.11! “ h boundary?

The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in much the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. ( l. 10). Suppose a continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density p. Choose any convenient origin 0 and let the position vector of any point in the charge distribution be r. The charge density p may vary from point to point, i.e., it is a function of 1'. Divide the charge distribution into small volume elements of size AV. The charge in a volume element AVis pAV. Now, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution) with position vector R (Fig. 1.24). Electric field due to the charge pAVis given by Coulomb’s law: 1 p AV f, 47580 r12 (1 .26) where r’ is the distance between the charge element and P, and r’ is a unit vector in the direction from the charge element to P. By the superposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge distribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different volume elements: 1 pAV-, 4,180 MEN #2 r (1.27) Note that p, r’, i-’ all can vary from point to point.

We have yet to answer one major question in this connection. What is the analogue of mass in rotational motion? We shall attempt to answer this question in the present section. To keep the discussion simple, we shall consider rotation about a fixed axis only. Let us try to get an expression for the kinetic energy of a rotating body. We know that for a body rotating about a fixed axis, each particle of the body moves in a circle with linear velocity given by Eq. (7.19). (Refer to Fig. 7.16). For a particle at a distance from the axis, the linear velocity is vi = ria). The kinetic energy of motion of this particle is ki = lrnivi2 = imirizwz 2 2 where miis the mass of the particle. The total kinetic energy K of the body is then given by the sum of the kinetic energies of individual particles, K = ilk, = gimirfwz) i:1 i:1 Here n is the number of particles in the body. Note wis the same for all particles. Hence, taking wout of the sum, K = l(02(anmiri2) 2 i:l We define a new parameter characterising the rigid body, called the moment of inertia I , given by I = Emir? (7.34) i:l With this definition, 1 K = 51602 (7.35) Note that the parameter I is independent of the magnitude of the angular velocity. It is a characteristic of the rigid body and the axis about which it rotates. Compare Eq. (7 .35) for the kinetic energy of a rotating body with the expression for the kinetic energy of a body in linear (translational) motion, K=lmv2 2 Here, m is the mass of the body and v is its velocity. We have already noted the analogy between angular velocity to (in respect of rotational motion about a fixed axis) and linear velocity v (in respect of linear motion). It is then evident that the parameter, moment of inertia I, is the desired rotational analogue of mass in linear motion. In rotation (about a ﬁxed axis), the moment of inertia plays a similar role as mass does in linear motion. We now apply the definition Eq. (7.34), to calculate the moment of inertia in two simple cases. (a) Consider a thin ring of radius R and mass M, rotating in its own plane around its centre 2019-20",0
1536,1477,"4 gradually, it got organised. As a social science discipline, geography studies the ‘spatial organisation’ and ‘spatial integration’. Geography as a discipline is concerned with three sets of questions: (i) Some questions are related to the identiﬁcation of the patterns of natural and cultural features as found over the surface of the earth. These are the questions about what? (ii) Some questions are related to the distribution of the natural and human / cultural features over the surface of the earth. These are the questions about where? Taken together, both these questions take care of distributional and locational aspects of the natural and cultural features. These questions provided inventorised information of what features and where located. It was a very popular approach during the colonial period. These two questions did not make geography a scientiﬁc discipline till the third question was added. (iii) The third question is related to the explanation or the causal relationships between features and the processes and phenomena. This aspect of geography is related to the question, why? Geography as a discipline is related to space and takes note of spatial characteristics and attributes. It studies the patterns of distribution, location and concentration of phenomena over space and interprets them providing explanations for these patterns. It takes note of the associations and inter- relationships between the phenomena over space and interprets them providing explanations for these patterns. It also takes note of the associations and inter-relationships between the phenomena resulting from the dynamic interaction between human beings and their physical environment. GEOGRAPHY As AN INTEGRATING DISCIPLINE Geography is a discipline of synthesis. It attempts spatial synthesis, and history attempts temporal synthesis. Its approach is holistic in nature. It recognises the fact that the world is a system of interdependencies. FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY The present world is being perceived as a global village. The distances have been reduced by better means of transportation increasing accessibility. The audio-visual media and information technology have enriched the data base. Technology has provided better chances of monitoring natural phenomena as well as the economic and social parameters. Geography as an integrating discipline has interface with numerous natural and social sciences. All the sciences, whether natural or social, have one basic objective, of understanding the reality. Geography attempts to comprehend the associations of phenomena as related in sections of reality. Figure 1.1 shows the relationship of geography with other sciences. Every discipline, concerned with scientific knowledge is linked with geography as many of their elements vary over space. Geography helps in understanding the reality in totality in its spatial perspective. Geography, thus, not only takes note of the differences in the phenomena from place to place but integrates them holistically which may be different at other places. A geographer is required to have a broad understanding of all the related fields, to be able to logically integrate them. This integration can be understood with some examples. Geography inﬂuences historical events. Spatial distance itself has been a very potent factor to alter the course of history of the world. Spatial depth provided defence to many countries, particularly in the last century. In traditional warfare, countries with large size in area, gain time at the cost of space. The defence provided by oceanic expanse around the countries of the new world has protected them from wars being imposed on their soil. If we look at the historical events world over, each one of them can be interpreted geographically. In India, Himalayas have acted as great barriers and provided protection but the passes provided routes to the migrants and invaders from Central Asia. The sea coast has encouraged contact with people from East and Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. Navigation technology helped European countries to colonise a number of countries of Asia and Africa, including India as they got accessibility 2019-2020",2

In addition, for (b), the force on the block by the cylinder and the force on the cylinder by the block also constitute an action-reaction pair. The important thing to remember is that an action-reaction pair consists of mutual forces which are always equal and opposite between two bodies. Two forces on the same body which happen to be equal and opposite can never constitute an action-reaction pair. The force of gravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal force on the mass by the ﬂoor are not action- reaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal and opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest. They are not so for case (b), as seen already. The weight of the system is 270 N, while the normal force R’ is 267.3 N. 4 The practice of drawing free-body diagrams is of great help in solving problems in mechanics. It allows you to clearly define your system and consider all forces on the system due to objects that are not part of the system itself. A number of exercises in this and subsequent chapters will help you cultivate this practice. SUMNIARY Aristotle's View that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and arrived at the law of inertia. Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased thus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of unifom motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise’. In simple terms, the First Law is “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero"". Momentum (p) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (V) : p = mv Newton’s second law of motion : The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus F=kd—p=kma dt where F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant of proportionality k = 1 in SI units. Then The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s2, [a] The second law is consistent with the First Law [F = 0 implies a = 0) (b) It is a vector equation (c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided F is the total external force on the system and a is the acceleration of the system as a whole. (d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant. That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the history of motion. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum. The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short, one can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during the action of the impulsive force. Newton’s third law of motion: To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction 2019-20",0

Petrol pumps are considered as a lower order function in the United States while it is an urban function in India. Even within a country, rating of functions may vary according to the regional economy. Facilities available in the villages of developed countries may be considered rare in villages of developing and less developed countries. The census of India, 1991 defines urban settlements as “All places which have municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee and have a minimum population of 5000 persons, at least 75 per cent of male workers are engaged in non-agricultural pursuits and a density of population of at least 400 persons per square kilometers are urban. TYPES AND PATTERNS OF SETTLEMENTS Settlements may also be classiﬁed by their shape, patterns types. The major types classiﬁed by shape are: (i) Compact or Nucleated settlements: These settlements are those in which large number of houses are built very close to each other. Such settlements develop along river valleys and in fertile plains. Communities are closely knit and share common occupations.

They are dominated by primary activities such as agriculture, animal husbandary, ﬁshing etc. The settlements size is relatively small. Some factors affecting the location of rural settlements are : Fig. 10.3 : Siting near water Water Supply Usually rural settlements are located near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and springs where water can be easily obtained.

This example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere’s law can be applied readily. It should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any loop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in every case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in Section 4.6, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression B = ,uOI/ZR [Eq. (4.16)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However, there exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law can be conveniently applied. We shall use it in the next section to calculate the magnetic field produced by two commonly used and very useful magnetic systems: the solenoid and the toroid. 4.8 THE SOLENOID AND THE TOROID The solenoid and the toroid are two pieces of equipment which generate magnetic fields. The television uses the solenoid to generate magnetic fields needed. The synchrotron uses a combination of both to generate the high magnetic fields required. In both, solenoid and toroid, we come across a situation of high symmetry where Ampere’s law can be conveniently applied. 2019-20",0

Ampere’s circuital law considers an open surface with a boundary (Fig. 4.14). The surface has current passing through it. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small line elements. Consider one such element of length 011. We take the value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, Bt, at this element and multiply it by the length of that element dl [Note: I I B tdl=B~d I]. All such products are added together. We consider the limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number gets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s law Boundary Surface states that this integral is equal to #0 times the total current FIGURE 4. 14 passing through the surface, i.e., §B-dl = #01 [4. l7(a)] where I is the total current through the surface.

Let the ﬁngers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the boundary is traversed in the loop integral §B~dL Then the direction of the thumb gives the sense in which the current I is regarded as positive.

Therefore. the total of these voltages must be obtained using the Pythagorean theorem: VR+C 2 VVIE) + W2 = 220 V Thus. if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken into account. the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor is equal to the voltage of the source. 9' L mama 251,0

1544,630,"356 PHYSICS The damping force depends on the nature of the surrounding medium. If the block is immersed in a liquid, the magnitude of damping will be much greater and the dissipation of energy much faster. The damping force is generally proportional to velocity of the bob. [Remember Stokes’ Law, Eq. (10.19)] and acts opposite to the direction of velocity. If the damping force is denoted by F d, we have Fd =—bv (1430) where the positive constant b depends on characteristics of the medium (viscosity, for example) and the size and shape of the block, etc. Eq. (14.30) is usually valid only for small velocity. When the mass m is attached to the spring (hung vertically as shown in Fig. 14.19) and released, the spring will elongate a little and the mass will settle at some height. This position, shown by O in Fig 14.19, is the equilibrium position of the mass. If the mass is pulled down or pushed up a little, the restoring force on the block due to the spring is FS = —kx, where x is the displacement* of the mass from its equilibrium position. Thus, the total force acting on the mass at any time t, is F = 40: —bv. If a(t) is the acceleration of mass at time t, then by Newton’s Law of Motion applied along the direction of motion, we have m a(t) = —k x(t) — b v(t) (14.31) Here we have dropped the vector notation because we are discussing one-dimensional motion. Using the first and second derivatives of x (t) for v (t) and a (t), respectively, we have 2 d): +bd—x+kx=0 (14-32) dt (:11: The solution of Eq. (14.32) describes the motion of the block under the inﬂuence of a damping force which is proportional to velocity. The solution is found to be of the form x(t) = A e‘bt/Zm cos (out + ¢) (14.33) m where A is the amplitude and (0' is the angular frequency of the damped oscillator given by, 2 60': E_ b (14.34) m 4m2 In this function, the cosine function has a period 27r/a)’ but the function x(t) is not strictly periodic because of the factor 64’ ”2’” which decreases continuously with time. However, if the decrease is small in one time period T, the motion represented by Eq. (14.33) is approximately periodic. The solution, Eq. (14.33), can be graphically represented as shown in Fig. 14.20. We can regard it as a cosine function whose amplitude, which is Aéb ”2m, gradually decreases with time. 10 ‘10“ 5 10 15 2o 25 t Fig. 14.20 A damped oscillator is approximately periodic with decreasing amplitude of oscillation. With greater damping, oscillations die out faster. Now the mechanical energy of the undamped oscillator is 1/ 2 kA2. For a damped oscillator, the amplitude is not constant but depends on time. For small damping, we may use the same expression but regard the amplitude as A ebt/Zm E(t) =% k A2 6%... (14.35) Equation (14.35) shows that the total energy of the system decreases exponentially with time. Note that small damping means that the b km dimensionless ratio [ jis much less than 1. * Under gravity, the block will be at a certain equilibrium position 0 on the spring; x here represents the disp lacement from that position. 2019-20",0

LEARNING OBJECTIVES studying this state the need for special purpose books; record the transactions in cash book and post them in the ledger; prepare the petty cash book; record the transactions in the special purpose books; post the entries in the special purpose book and to the ledger; balance the ledger accounts. n chapter 3, you learnt that all the business transactions are first recorded in the journal and then they are posted in the ledger accounts. A small business may be able to record all its transactions in one book only, i.e., the journal. But as the business expands and the number of transactions becomes large, it may become cumbersome to jour—nalise each transaction. For quick, efficient and accurate recording of business transactions, Journal is sub-divided into special journals. Many of the business transactions are repetitive in nature. They can be easily recorded in special journals, each meant for recording all the transactions of a similar nature. For example, all cash transactions may be recorded in one book, all credit sales transactions in another book and all credit purchases transactions in yet another book and so on. These special journals are also called daybooks or subsidiary books. Transactions that cannot be recorded in any special journal are recorded in journal called the Journal Proper. Special journals prove economical and make division of labour possible in accounting work.

Water bodies also have fish which can be caught for diet and navigable rivers and lakes can be used for transportation. Land People choose to settle near fertile lands suitable for agriculture. In Europe villages grew up near rolling country avoiding swampy, low lying land while people in south east Asia chose to live near low lying river valleys and coastal plains suited for wet rice cultivation. Early settlers chose plain areas with fertile soils. Upland Upland which is not prone to ﬂooding was chosen to prevent damage to houses and loss of life. Thus, in low lying river basins people chose to settle on terraces and levees which are “dry points”. In tropical countries people build their houses on stilts near marshy lands to protect themselves from ﬂood, insects and animal pests. Building Material The availability of building materials- wood, stone near settlements is another advantage. Early villages were built in forest clearings where wood was plentiful. Fig. 10.4 : House on stilts In loess areas of China, cave dwellings were important and African Savanna’s building materials were mud bricks and the Eskimos, in polar regions, use ice blocks to construct igloos. Defence During the times of political instability, war, hostility of neighbouring groups villages were built on defensive hills and islands. In Nigeria, upstanding inselbergs formed good defensive sites. In India most of the forts are located on higher grounds or hills. Planned Settlements Sites that are not spontaneously chosen by villagers themselves, planned settlements are constructed by governments by providing shelter, water and other infrastructures on acquired lands. The scheme of villagisation in Ethiopia and the canal colonies in Indira Gandhi canal command area in India are some good examples. Rural Settlement Patterns Patterns of rural settlements reﬂect the way the houses are sited in relation to each other. The site of the village, the surrounding topography and terrain inﬂuence the shape and size of a village. Rural settlements may be classiﬁed on the basis of a number of criteria: (i) On the basis of setting: The main types are plain villages, plateau Villages, coastal villages, forest villages and desert villages. On the basis of functions: There may be farming villages, fishermen’s villages, lumberjack villages, pastoral villages etc. On the basis of forms or shapes of the settlements: These may be a number of geometrical forms and shapes such as Linear, rectangular, circular star like, T-shaped village, double village, cross-shaped village etc. Linear pattern: In such settlements houses are located along a road, railway line, river, canal edge of a valley or along a levee. Rectangular pattern: Such patterns of rural settlements are found in plain areas or wide inter montane valleys. The roads are rectangular and cut each other at right angles.

For velocities small compared to the speed of light, we can use the same formulae which we use for sound waves. The fractional change in frequency Av/v is given by —vr81 di 81 / c, where vradial is the component of the source velocity along the line joining the observer to the source relative to the observer; vra di 81 is considered positive when the source moves away from the observer. Thus, the Doppler shift can be expressed as: AV _ Uradial V C (10.9) The formula given above is valid only when the speed of the source is small compared to that of light. A more accurate formula for the Doppler effect which is valid even when the speeds are close to that of light, requires the use of Einstein’s special theory of relativity. The Doppler effect for light is very important in astronomy. It is the basis for the measurements of the radial velocities of distant galaxies.

1550,852,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS (iii) the occurrence of competition in nature comes from what is called ‘competitive release’. A species whose distribution is restricted to a small geographical area because of the presence of a competitively superior species, is found to expand its distributional range dramatically when the competing species is experimentally removed. Connell’s elegant field experiments showed that on the rocky sea coasts of Scotland, the larger and competitively superior barnacle Balanus dominates the intertidal area, and excludes the smaller barnacle Chathamalus from that zone. In general, herbivores and plants appear to be more adversely affected by competition than carnivores. Gause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’ states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indeﬁnitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually. This may be true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise. More recent studies do not support such gross generalisations about competition. While they do not rule out the occurrence of interspeciﬁc competition in nature, they point out that species facing competition might evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism is ‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete for the same resource, they could avoid competition by choosing, for instance, different times for feeding or different foraging patterns. MacArthur showed that five closely related species of warblers living on the same tree were able to avoid competition and co-exist due to behavioural differences in their foraging activities. Parasitism: Considering that the parasitic mode of life ensures free lodging and meals, it is not surprising that parasitism has evolved in so many taxonomic groups from plants to higher vertebrates. Many parasites have evolved to be host-specific (they can parasitise only a single species of host) in such a way that both host and the parasite tend to co-evolve; that is, if the host evolves special mechanisms for rejecting or resisting the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to counteract and neutralise them, in order to be successful with the same host species. In accordance with their life styles, parasites evolved special adaptations such as the loss of unnecessary sense organs, presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling on to the host, loss of digestive system and high reproductive capacity. The life cycles of parasites are often complex, involving one or two intermediate hosts or vectors to facilitate parasitisation of its primary host. The human liver ﬂuke (a trematode parasite) depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a ﬁsh) to complete its life cycle. The malarial parasite needs a 2019—2020 235",1

We walk, run and ride a bicycle. Even when we are sleeping, air moves into and out of our lungs and blood ﬂows in arteries and veins. We see leaves falling from trees and water ﬂowing down a dam. Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving within its local group of galaxies. Motion is change in position of an object with time. How does the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error. In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion. What causes motion described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the subject matter of Chapter 5. 3.2 POSITION.

1553,845,"272 BIOLOGY Automobiles are a major cause for atmospheric pollution atleast in the metro cities. As the number of vehicles increase on the streets, this problem is now shifting to the other cities too. Proper maintenance of automobiles along with use of lead-free petrol or diesel can reduce the pollutants they emit. Catalytic converters, having expensive metals namely platinum-palladium and rhodium as the catalysts, are fitted into automobiles for reducing emission of poisonous gases. As the exhaust passes through the catalytic converter, unburnt hydrocarbons are converted into carbon dioxide and water, and carbon monoxide and nitric oxide are changed to carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas, respectively. Motor vehicles equipped with catalytic converter should use unleaded petrol because lead in the petrol inactivates the catalyst. In India, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act came into force in 1981, but was amended in 1987 to include noise as an air pollutant. Noise is undesired high level of sound. We have got used to associating loud sounds with pleasure and entertainment not realising that noise causes psychological and physiological disorders in humans. The bigger the city, the bigger the function, the greater the noise!! A brief exposure to extremely high sound level, 150 dB or more generated by take off of a jet plane or rocket, may damage ear drums thus permanently impairing hearing ability. Even chronic exposure to a relatively lower noise level of cities may permanently damage hearing abilities of humans. Noise also causes sleeplessness, increased heart beat, altered breathing pattern, thus considerably stressing humans. Considering the many dangerous effects of noise pollution can you identify the unnecessary sources of noise pollution around you which can be reduced immediately without any ﬁnancial loss to anybody? Reduction of noise in our industries can be affected by use of sound- absorbent materials or by mufﬂing noise. Stringent following of laws laid down in relation to noise like delimitation of horn-free zones around hospitals and schools, permissible sound-levels of crackers and of loud- speakers, timings after which loudspeakers cannot be played, etc., need to be enforced to protect ourselves from noise pollution. 16. 1 . 1 Controlling Vehicular Air Pollution: A Case Study of Delhi With its very large population of vehicular traffic, Delhi leads the coun- try in its levels of air-pollution — it has more cars than the states of Gujarat and West Bengal put together. In the 1990s, Delhi ranked fourth among the 41 most polluted cities of the world. Air pollution problems in Delhi became so serious that a public interest litigation (PIL) was ﬁled in the Supreme Court of India. After being censured very strongly by the Supreme Court, under its directives, the government was asked to take, within a speciﬁed time period, appropriate meas- ures, including switching over the entire ﬂeet of public transport, i.e., buses, from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG).

In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some leguminous plants the leafbase may become swollen, which is called the pulvinus. The petiole help hold the blade to light. Long thin ﬂexible petioles allow leaf blades to ﬂutter in wind, thereby cooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface. The lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded part of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is, usually, a middle prominent vein, which is known as the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade and act as channels of transport for water, minerals and food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface and extent of incision of lamina varies in different leaves. 5.3. 1 Venation The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate (Figure 5.7 b). When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as parallel (Figure 5.7 0). Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation, while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons. 5.3.2 Types of Leaves A leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up to the midrib breaking it into a number of leaﬂets, the leaf is called compound. A bud is present in the am’l of petiole in both simple and compound leaves, but not in the am’l of leaﬂets of the compound leaf. The compound leaves may be of two types (Figure 5.8).

1555,848,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photo- Photosystem I pho sphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from l—l ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of light. When the two photosystems work in a ' W ' series, ﬁrst PS 11 and then the PS I, a process called ‘ non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The \ two photosystems are connected through an \ 03% E1 tr electron transport chain, as seen earlier— in the \\ {9 US$13; Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H+ are \ synthesised by this kind of electron ﬂow (Figure 13.5). When only PS I is functional, the electron is circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic ﬂow of electrons (Figure 13.6). A possible location where this could be happening is in the stroma lamellae. While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS 11 the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figure 13.6). The cyclic ﬂow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H“. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation. Figure 13.6 Cyclic photophosphorylation 13.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis Let us now ﬂy and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The Chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 14). Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 13.7). (a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.",1

For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (say, z—axis) of rotation, LZ = [(0, where I is the moment of inertia about z—axis. In general, the angular momentum L for such a body is not along the axis of rotation. Only if the body is symmetric about the axis of rotation, L is along the axis of rotation. In that case, |L| = LZ = I a). The angular acceleration of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by Ia = r. If the external torque ”C acting on the body is zero, the component of angular momentum about the fixed axis (say, z—axis), LZ (=Ico) of such a rotating body is constant. 1 7.

Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass. (i.e.. the translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K’ and the kinetic energl of the centre of mass MVZ/2. K = K’ + MW/ 2 Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in N ewton‘s Second Law and also Newton's Third Law for particles. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of particles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton‘s second law for particles. but also N ewton's third law with the provision that the forces between any two particles act along the line joining the particles. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque are independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple. total external force is zero, but total torque is non—zero. The total torque on a system is independent of the origin if the total external force is zero. The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational field does not vary from one part of the body to the other. The angular momentum L and the angular velocity 0) are not necessarily parallel vectors. However. for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a fixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body. the relation L = 10) holds good. where I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis. 2019-20",0

The body cavity, which is lined by mesoderm is called coelom. Animals possessing coelom are called coelomates, e. g., annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In some animals, the body cavity is not lined by mesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and endoderm. Such a body cavity is called pseudocoelom and the animals possessing them are called pseudocoelomates, e.g., aschehninthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals in Figure 4.3 Diagrammatic sectional View of : WhiCh the body cavity is absent are called (a) Coelomate (b) Pseudocoelomate acoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c).

For example, in earthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation and the phenomenon is known as metamerism. 4. 1 .6 Notochord Notochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on the dorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals with notochord are called chordates and those animals which do not form this structure are called non-chordates, e. g., porifera to echinoderms. 4.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS The broad classiﬁcation of Animalia based on common fundamental features as mentioned in the preceding sections is given in Figure 4.4.",1

The golgi apparatus principally performs the function of packaging materials, to be delivered either to the intra—cellular targets or secreted outside the cell. Materials to be packaged in the form of vesicles from the ER fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus and move towards the maturing face. This explains, Why the golgi apparatus remains in close association with the endoplasmic reticulum. A number of proteins synthesised by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum are modiﬁed in the cisternae of the golgi apparatus before they are released from its trans face. Golgi apparatus is the important site of formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. 8.5.3.3 Lysosomes These are membrane bound vesicular structures formed by the process of packaging in the golgi apparatus. The isolated lysosomal vesicles have been found to be very rich in almost all types of hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases — lipases, proteases, carbohydrases) optimally active at the acidic pH. These enzymes are capable of digesting carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. 8.5.3.4 Vacuoles ’Ihe vacuole is the membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. It contains water, sap, excretory product and other materials not useful for the cell. The vacuole is bound by a single membrane called tonoplast. In plant cells the vacuoles can occupy up to 90 per cent of the volume of the cell. In plants, the tonoplast facilitates the transport of a number of ions and other materials against concentration gradients into the vacuole, hence their concentration is signiﬁcantly higher in the vacuole than in the cytoplasm. In Amoeba the contractile vacuole is important for osmoregulation and excretion. In many cells, as in protists, food vacuoles are formed by engulﬁng the food particles. 8. 5.4 Mitochondria Mitochondria (sing.: mitochondrion), unless speciﬁcally stained, are not easily visible under the microscope. The number of mitochondria per cell is variable depending on the physiological activity of the cells. In terms of shape and size also, considerable degree of variability is observed. Typically it is sausage-shaped or cylindrical having a diameter of 0.2- 1 .0m (average 0.5um) and length 1 .0-4. 1 mm. Each mitochondrion is a double",1

They have organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, segmented and coelomate animals. The body of arthropods is covered by chitinous exoskeleton. The body consists of head, thorax and abdomen. They have jointed appendages (arthros-joint, poda-appendages). Respiratory organs are gills, book gills, book lungs or tracheal system. Circulatory system is of open type. Sensory organs like antennae, eyes (compound and simple), statocysts or balancing organs are present. Excretion takes place through malpighian tubules. They are mostly dioecious. Fertilisation is usually internal. They are mostly oviparous. Development may be direct or indirect. Examples: Economically important insects — Apis (Honey bee), Bombyx (Silkworm), Laccifer (Lac insect) Vectors — Anopheles, Culex and Aedes (Mosquitoes) Gregarious pest — Locusta (Locust) Living fossil — Limulus (King crab). 4.2.8 Phylum — Mollusca This is the second largest animal phylum (Figure 4. 13). Molluscs are terrestrial or aquatic (marine or fresh water) having an organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate animals. Body is covered by a calcareous shell and is unsegmented with a distinct head, muscular foot and visceral hump. A soft and spongy layer of skin forms a mantle over the visceral hump. The space between the hump and the mantle is called the mantle cavity in which feather like gills are present. They have respiratory and excretory functions. The anterior head region has sensory tentacles. The mouth contains a file-like rasping organ for feeding, called radula.

It is often not linear and it depends on the magnetic history of the sample. Figure 5.14 depicts the behaviour of the material as we take it through one cycle of magnetisation. Let the material be unmagnetised initially. We place it in a solenoid and increase the current through the solenoid. The magnetic field B in the material rises and saturates as depicted in the curve 0a. This behaviour represents the alignment and merger of domains until no further enhancement is possible. It is pointless to increase the current (and hence the magnetic intensity H) beyond this. Next, we decrease H and reduce it to zero. At H = O, B i O. This is represented by the curve ab. The value of B at H = O is called retentivity or remanence. In Fig. 5.14, BR ~ 1.2 T, where the subscript R denotes retentivity. The domains are not completely randomised even though the external driving field has been removed. Next, the current in the solenoid is reversed and slowly increased. Certain domains are ﬂipped until the net field inside stands nulliﬁed. This is represented by the curve bc. The value of H at c is called coercivity. In Fig. 5.14 HC ~ —90 A m‘l.

1564,1457,"HOBZCHO] CHAPTER ‘- rou have studied geography as one of the components of your Social Science course upto the secondary stage. You are already aware of some of the phenomena of geographical nature in the world and its different parts. Now, you will study ‘Geography’ as an independent subject and learn about the physical environment of the earth, human activities and their interactive relationships. Therefore, a pertinent question you can ask at this stage is — Why should we study geography? We live on the surface of the earth. Our lives are affected by our surroundings in many ways. We depend on the resources to sustain ourselves in the surrounding areas. Primitive societies subsisted on ‘natural means of subsistence’, i.e. edible plants and animals. With the passage of time, we developed technologies and started producing our food using natural resources such as land, soil and water. We adjusted our food habits and clothing according to the prevailing weather conditions. There are variations in the natural resource base, technological development, adaptation with and modification of physical environment, social organisations and cultural development. As a student of geography, you should be curious to know about all the phenomena which vary over space. You learn about the diverse lands and people. You should also be interested in understanding the changes which have taken place over time. Geography equips you to appreciate diversity and investigate into the causes responsible for creating such variations over time and space. You will develop skills to understand the globe converted into maps and have a visual sense GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE of the earth’s surface. The understanding and the skills obtained in modern scientific techniques such as GIS and computer cartography equip you to meaningfully contribute to the national endeavour for development. Now the next question which you may like to ask is — What is geography? You know that earth is our home. It is also the home of many other creatures, big and small, which live on the earth and sustain. The earth’s surface is not uniform. It has variations in its physical features. There are mountains, hills, valleys, plains, plateaus, oceans, lakes, deserts and wilderness. There are variations in its social and cultural features too. There are villages, cities, roads, railways, ports, markets and many other elements created by human beings across the entire period of their cultural development. This variation provides a clue to the understanding of the relationship between the physical environment and social / cultural features. The physical environment has provided the stage, on which human societies enacted the drama of their creative skills with the tools and techniques which they invented and evolved in the process of their cultural development. Now, you should be able to attempt the answer of the question posed earlier as to “What is geography”? In very simple words, it can be said that geography is the description of the earth. The term geography was first coined by Eratosthenese, a Greek scholar (276- 1 94 BC.). The word has been derived from two roots from Greek language geo (earth) and graphos (description). 2019-2020",2

Where has the remaining energy gone? There is a transient period before the system settles to the situation (b). During this period, a transient current ﬂows from the first capacitor to the second. Energy is lost during this time in the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation. EXAMPLE 2.10 SUMMARY 1. Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external force [equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge q from a point R to a point P is VP — VR, which is the difference in potential energy of charge q between the final and initial points. 2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge [by an external agency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a point is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential difference between two points which is physically significant. If potential at infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector r due to a point charge Q placed at the origin is given is given by 1 Q 4mg, r V(r) = 3.

An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant value. For a point charge. concentric spheres centred at a location of the charge are equipotential surfaces.

Solution For a particle, de Broglie wavelength, A = h/ p Kinetic energy, K = pZ/Zm Then, i=h/«l2mK For the same kinetic energy K, the de Broglie wavelength associated with the particle is inversely proportional to the square root of their masses. A proton (iH) is 1836 times massive than an electron and an oc-particle (gHe) four times that of a proton. Hence, 0L — particle has the shortest de Broglie wavelength. PROBABILITY INTERPRETATION T0 MATTER WAVES It is worth pausing here to reﬂect on just what a matter wave associated with a particle, say, an electron, means. Actually, a truly satisfactory physical understanding of the dual nature of matter and radiation has not emerged so far. The great founders of quantum mechanics (Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, and many others) struggled with this and related concepts for long. Still the deep physical interpretation of quantum mechanics continues to be an area of active research. Despite this, the concept of matter wave has been mathematically introduced in modern quantum mechanics with great success. An important milestone in this connection was when Max Born (1882- 1970) suggested a probability interpretation to the matter wave amplitude. According to this, the intensity (square of the amplitude) of the matter wave at a point determines the probability density of the particle at that point. Probability density means probability per unit volume. Thus, if A is the amplitude of the wave at a point, |A| 2 AV is the probability of the particle being found in a small volume AV around that point. Thus, if the intensity of matter wave is large in a certain region, there is a greater probability of the particle being found there than Where the intensity is small. ‘ Example 11.6 A particle is moving three times as fast as an electron.

The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change of current and mutual inductance of the two coils. 6.9.2 Self-inductance In the previous sub-section, we considered the ﬂux in one solenoid due to the current in the other. It is also possible that emf is induced in a single isolated coil due to change of ﬂux through the coil by means of varying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called self-induction. In this case, ﬂux linkage through a coil of N turns is proportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as N%«I Ng=L1 $13 where constant of proportionality Lis called self-inductance of the coil. It is also called the coeﬁicient of self-induction of the coil. When the current is varied, the ﬂux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced in the coil. Using Eq.

It is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple geometries.

1568,283,PHYSICS The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a third system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other”. The Zeroth Law leads to the concept of temperature. Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the molecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over—all kinetic energy of the system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system. Heat is the energy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the surroundings. Work is energy transfer brought. about. by other means. such as moving the piston of a cylinder containing the gas. by raising or lowering some weight. connected to it. The first. law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to any system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and work) is taken into account.

(ii) Field emission: By applying a very strong electric ﬁeld (of the order of 108 V m‘l) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a spark plug. (iii) Photoelectric emission: When light of suitable frequency illuminates a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These photo(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons. 1 1.3 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT 1 1.3.1 Hertz's observations The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz (1 857 - 1 894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments. In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp. Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of free, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions in the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the surrounding space. 1 1.3.2 Hallwachs’ and Lenard's observations Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of photoelectric emission in detail during 1886- 1902. Lenard (1862- 1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing two electrodes (metal plates), current ﬂows in the circuit (Fig. 1 1.1).

As Fig. 10.23(a) shows, the incident sunlight is unpolarised. The dots stand for polarisation perpendicular to the plane of the figure. The double arrows show polarisation in the plane of the ﬁgure. (There is no phase relation between these two in unpolarised light). Under the inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld of the incident wave the electrons in the molecules acquire components of motion in both these directions. We have drawn an observer looking at 90° to the direction of the sun. Clearly, charges accelerating parallel to the double arrows do not radiate energy towards this observer since their acceleration has no transverse component. The radiation scattered by the molecule is therefore represented by dots. It is polarised perpendicular to the plane of the ﬁgure. This explains the polarisation of scattered light from the sky.

They also develop a very strong, elastic, lignocellulosic secondary cell walls, to carry water to long distances even under extreme tension. Try to correlate the various anatomical features you encounter in plants to the functions they perform. Plants show another interesting phenomenon. The living differentiated cells, that by now have lost the capacity to divide can regain the capacity of division under certain conditions. This phenomenon is termed as dedifferentiation. For example, formation of meristems — interfascicular cambium and cork cambium from fully differentiated parenchyma cells. While doing so, such meristems / tissues are able to divide and produce cells that once again lose the capacity to divide but mature to perform speciﬁc functions, i.e., get redifferentiated. List some of the tissues in a woody dicotyledenous plant that are the products of redifferentiation. How would you describe a tumour? What would you call the parenchyma cells that are made to divide under controlled laboratory conditions during plant tissue culture? Recall, in Section 15. 1. 1, we have mentioned that the grth in plants is open, i.e., it can be indeterminate or determinate. Now, we may say that even differentiation in plants is open, because cells / tissues arising out of the same meristem have different structures at maturity. The final structure at maturity of a cell / tissue is also determined by the location of the cell within. For example, cells positioned away from root apical meristems differentiate as root-cap cells, while those pushed to the periphery mature as epidermis. Can you add a few more examples of open differentiation correlating the position of a cell to its position in an organ? 1 5.3 DEVELOPMENT Development is a term that includes all changes that an organism goes through during its life cycle from germination of the seed to senescence. Diagrammatic representation of the sequence of processes which constitute the development of a cell of a higher plant is given in Figure 15.8. It is also applicable to tissues / organs. 245",1
1573,895,"CHAPTER 13 12083CH13 ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS 1 3.1 Organism and Its Environment 13.2 Populations Our living world is fascinatingly diverse and amazingly complex. We can try to understand its complexity by investigating processes at various levels of biological organisation—macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs, individual organisms, population, communities, ecosystems and biomes. At any level of biological organisation we can ask two types of questions — for example, when we hear the bulbul singing early morning in the garden, we may ask — ‘How does the bird sing?’ Or, ‘Why does the bird sing ?’ The ‘how—type’ questions seek the mechanism behind the process while the ‘why- type’ questions seek the signiﬁcance of the process. For the ﬁrst question in our example, the answer might be in terms of the operation of the voice box and the vibrating bone in the bird, whereas for the second question the answer may lie in the bird’s need to communicate with its mate during breeding season. When you observe nature around you with a scientific frame of mind you will certainly come up with many interesting questions of both types - Why are night-blooming ﬂowers generally white? How does the bee know which ﬂower has nectar? Why does cactus have so many thorns? How does the chick spures recognise her own mother?, and so on. 2019—2020",1
1574,1226,"EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION A survey of animal kingdom presents a variety of excretory structures. In most of the invertebrates, these structures are simple tubular forms whereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Some of these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia or ﬂame cells are the excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e. g., Planaria), rotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate — Amphioxus. Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and ﬂuid volume regulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory structures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove nitrogenous wastes and maintain a ﬂuid and ionic balance. Malpighian tubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including cockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous wastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform the excretory function in crustaceans like prawns. 19. 1 HUMAN EXCRETORY SYSTEM In humans, the excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra (Figure 19.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean Adrenal gland shaped structures situated between the levels of last thoracic and third lumbar velrrllalegga Renal artery vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of , , Renal vem the abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an PelWS adult human measures 10- 12 cm in length, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in thickness with an average weight of 120- 170 g. Towards the centre of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum through which ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum is a broad funnel shaped space called the Dorsal aorta Ureter renal pelvis with projections called calyces. 5:31? The outer layer of kidney is a tough a er Urethra capsule. Inside the kidney, there are two zones, an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The medulla is divided into a few conical masses (medullary pyramids) projecting into the calyces (sing: calyx).

An arrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the direction of electric ﬁeld from the two possible directions indicated by a tangent to the curve. A ﬁeld line is a space curve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions. Figure 1.1 7 shows the ﬁeld lines around some simple charge conﬁgurations. As mentioned earlier, the ﬁeld lines are in 3-dimensional space, though the ﬁgure shows them only in a plane. The ﬁeld lines of a single positive charge are radially outward while those of a single negative charge are radially inward. The ﬁeld lines around a system of two positive charges (q, q) give a vivid pictorial description of their mutual repulsion, while those around the conﬁguration of two equal and opposite charges (q, —q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction between the charges. The ﬁeld lines follow some important general properties: (i) Field lines start from positive charges and end at negative charges. If there is a single charge, they may start or end at inﬁnity. (ii) In a charge-free region, electric ﬁeld lines can be taken to be continuous curves without any breaks. (iii) Two ﬁeld lines can never cross each other. (If they did, the field at the point of intersection will not have a unique direction, which is absurd.) (iv) Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops. This follows from the conservative nature of electric ﬁeld (Chapter 2). 1 . 10 ELECTRIC FLUX Consider ﬂow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small ﬂat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The rate of ﬂow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the area per unit time 0 dS and represents the ﬂux of liquid ﬂowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is not parallel to the direction of ﬂow of liquid, i.e., to v, but makes an angle 0 with it, the projected area in a plane perpendicular to v is 0 ds cos 0. Therefore, the ﬂux going out of the surface dS is v. :1 ds. For the case of the electric ﬁeld, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric ﬂux. We should, however, note that there is no ﬂow of a physically observable quantity unlike the case of liquid ﬂow. In the picture of electric field lines described above, we saw that the number of ﬁeld lines crossing a unit area, placed normal to the ﬁeld at a point is a measure of the strength of electric field at that point.

1577,992,"SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS plant — cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth deposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the ﬂower, in turn, gets pollinated by the moth. The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as the seeds start developing. Why don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any others available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya, Onion, Labia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana? Try to find out which animals visit them and whether they could be pollinators. You’ll have to patiently observe the ﬂowers over a few days and at different times of the day. You could also try to see whether there is any correlation in the characteristics of a ﬂower to the animal that visits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the anthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination. Many insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about pollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/ nectar robbers. You may or may not be able to identijy the pollinators, but you will surely enjoy your efforts! Outbreeding Devices : Majority of ﬂowering plants produce hermaphrodite ﬂowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of the same ﬂower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression. Flowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self- pollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen release and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is released before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive much before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and stigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in contact with the stigma of the same ﬂower. Both these devices prevent autogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility. This is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same ﬂower or other ﬂowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. Another device to prevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual ﬂowers. If both male and female ﬂowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize (monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species such as papaya, male and female ﬂowers are present on different plants, that is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents both autogamy and geitonogamy. Pollen-pistil Interaction : Pollination does not guarantee the transfer of the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the stigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from the same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The pistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type (compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type, the pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that 2019-2020 31",1

The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit. Although the number of physical quantities appears to be very large, we need only a limited number of units for expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter- related with one another. The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. 2.2 THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement. Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently. The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows : 0 In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively. 0 In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively. 0 In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively. The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Systeme Internationale d’ Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, was developed and recommended by General Conference on Weights and Measures in 197 1 for 2019-20",0

It contains the fuel elements in suitably fabricated form. The fuel may be say enriched uranium (i.e., one that has greater abundance of 2351} than naturally occurring uranium). The core contains a moderator to slow down the neutrons. The core is surrounded by a reﬂector to reduce leakage. The energy (heat) released in ﬁssion is continuously removed by a suitable coolant. A containment vessel prevents the escape of radioactive ﬁssion products. The whole assembly is shielded to check harmful radiation from coming out. The reactor can be shut down by means of rods (made of, for example, cadmium) that have high absorption of neutrons. The coolant transfers heat to a working ﬂuid which in turn may produce stream. The steam drives turbines and generates electricity. Like any power reactor, nuclear reactors generate considerable waste products. But nuclear wastes need special care for treatment since they are radioactive and hazardous. Elaborate safety measures, both for reactor operation as well as handling and reprocessing the spent fuel, are required. These safety measures are a distinguishing feature of the Indian Atomic Energy programme. An appropriate plan is being evolved to study the possibility of converting radioactive waste into less active and short- lived material. 13.7.3 Nuclear fusion — energy generation in stars When two light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus, energy is released, since the larger nucleus is more tightly bound, as seen from the binding energy curve in Fig. 13. 1.

Distributions are very important and useful when dealing with systems containing large number of objects. As an example consider the ages of different persons in a city. It is not feasible to deal with the age of each individual. We can divide the people into groups: children up to age 20 years. adults between ages of 20 and 60. old people above 60. If we want more detailed information we can choose smaller intervals, 0- 1, 1-2 ..... 99—100 of age groups. When the size of the interval becomes smaller, say half year, the number of persons in the interval will also reduce. roughly half the original number in the one year interval.

1582,705,"Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Initially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small. As the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions on either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric field strength and hence drift current. This process continues until the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n junction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there is no net current. The loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of electron by the p-region causes a difference of potential across the junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is such as to oppose further ﬂow of carriers so that a condition of equilibrium exists. Figure 14.1 1 shows the p-n junction at equilibrium and the potential across the junction. The n-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired electrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p material. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of electron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a barrier potential.

A bridge has to be designed such that it can withstand the load of the ﬂowing traffic, the force of winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the design of buildings the use of beams and columns is very common. In both the cases, the overcoming of the problem of bending of beam under a load is of prime importance. The beam should not bend too much or break. Let us consider the case of a beam loaded at the centre and supported near its ends as shown in Fig. 9.8. A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth d when loaded at the centre by a load W sags by an amount given by 6= W l3/(4bd3Y) (9.17) Fig. 9.8 A beam supported at the ends and loaded at the centre. This relation can be derived using what you have already learnt and a little calculus. From Eq. (9.16). we see that to reduce the bending for a given load, one should use a material with a large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material, increasing the depth d rather than the breadth b is more effective in reducing the bending, since 6 is proportional to d ‘3 and only to b'1(of course the length lof the span should be as small as possible). But on increasing the depth, unless the load is exactly at the right place (difficult to arrange in a bridge with moving traffic). the deep bar may bend as shown in Fig. 9.9(b). This is called buckling. To avoid this, a common compromise is the cross-sectional shape shown in Fig. 9.9(c). This section provides a large load- bearing surface and enough depth to prevent bending. This shape reduces the weight of the beam without sacrificing the strength and hence reduces the cost. («—9 w (a) [b] (c) Fig. 9.9 Different cross-sectional shapes of a beam.

The answer to the question why the maximum height of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can also be provided by considering the elastic properties of rocks. A mountain base is not under uniform compression and this provides some shearing stress to the rocks under which they can ﬂow. The stress due to all the material on the top should be less than the critical shearing stress at which the rocks ﬂow. At the bottom of a mountain of height h, the force per unit area due to the weight of the mountain is hpg where p is the density of the material of the mountain and g is the acceleration 2019-20",0

Towards the same period at the end of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity (electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led to many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895, and of electron by J. J. Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in the understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufﬁciently low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took place between the two electrodes on applying the electric ﬁeld to the gas in the discharge tube. A ﬂuorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite to cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass, it being yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this ﬂuorescence was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the cathode. These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams of fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist J. J. Thomson (1856- 1940) conﬁrmed this hypothesis. By applying mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds across the discharge tube, J. J. Thomson was the ﬁrst to determine experimentally the speed and the speciﬁc charge [charge to mass ratio (e/ m)] of the cathode ray 2019-20",0

1593,1119,"176 BIOLOGY Biofortification — breeding crops with higher levels of vitamins and minerals, or higher protein and healthier fats — is the most practical means to improve public health. Breeding for improved nutritional quality is undertaken with the objectives of improving — (i) Protein content and quality; (ii) Oil content and quality; (iii) Vitamin content; and (iv) Micronutrient and mineral content. In 2000, maize hybrids that had twice the amount of the amino acids, lysine and tryptophan, compared to existing maize hybrids were developed. Wheat variety, Atlas 66, having a high protein content, has been used as a donor for improving cultivated wheat. It has been possible to develop an iron-fortiﬁed rice variety containing over ﬁve times as much iron as in commonly consumed varieties. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi has also released several vegetable crops that are rich in vitamins and minerals, e.g., vitamin A enriched carrots, spinach, pumpkin; vitamin C enriched bitter gourd, bathua mustard, tomato; iron and calcium enriched spinach and bathua; and protein enriched beans — broad, lablab, French and garden peas. 9.3 SINGLE CELL PROTEIN (SCP) Conventional agricultural production of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, etc., may not be able to meet the demand of food at the rate at which human and animal population is increasing. The shift from grain to meat diets also creates more demand for cereals as it takes 3- 10 Kg of grain to produce 1 Kg of meat by animal farming. Can you explain this statement in the light of your knowledge of food chains? More than 25 per cent of human population is suffering from hunger and malnutrition. One of the alternate sources of proteins for animal and human nutrition is Single Cell Protein (SCP). Microbes are being grown on an industrial scale as source of good protein. Blue-green algae like Spirulina can be grown easily on materials like waste water from potato processing plants (containing starch), straw, molasses, animal manure and even sewage, to produce large quantities and can serve as food rich in protein, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and vitamins. Incidentally such utilisation also reduces environmental pollution. Certain bacterial species like Methylophilus methylotrophus, because of its high rate of biomass production and growth, can be expected to produce 25 tonnes of protein.

1594,1247,"126 BIOLOGY Schwann (1 839), a British Zoologist, studied different types of animal cells and reported that cells had a thin outer layer which is today known as the ‘plasma membrane’. He also concluded, based on his studies on plant tissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of the plant cells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells. Schleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory. This theory however, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf Virchow (1855) ﬁrst explained that cells divided and new cells are formed from pre-existing cells (Omnis cellula—e cellula). He modiﬁed the hypothesis of Schleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a ﬁnal shape. Cell theory as understood today is: (i) all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells. (ii) all cells arise from pre-existing cells. 8.3 AN OVERVIEW OF CELL You have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/ or human cheek cells under the microscope. Let us recollect their structure. The onion cell which is a typical plant cell, has a distinct cell wall as its outer boundary and just within it is the cell membrane. The cells of the human cheek have an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Inside each cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus. This nucleus contains the chromosomes which in turn contain the genetic material, DNA. Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are called eukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus are prokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-ﬂuid matrix called cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is the main arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Various chemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’. Besides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound distinct structures called organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles. The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles. Ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells — both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes are found not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles — chloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER. Animal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle called centrosome which helps in cell division. Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities (Figure 8. 1). For example, Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 pm in length while bacteria",1
1595,1077,"294 BIOLOGY The amount of the ﬁltrate formed by the kidneys per minute is called glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR in a healthy individual is approximately 125 ml/ minute, i.e., 180 litres per day ! The lddneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular ﬁltration rate. One such efﬁcient mechanism is carried out by juxta glomerular apparatus (J GA). J GA is a special sensitive region formed by cellular modiﬁcations in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent arteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood ﬂow and thereby the GFR back to normal. A comparison of the volume of the ﬁltrate formed per day (1 80 litres per day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99 per cent of the ﬁltrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This process is called reabsorption. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms. For example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na’“, etc., in the ﬁltrate are reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport. Reabsorption of water also occurs passively in the initial segments of the nephron (Figure 19.5). During urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H’“, K+ and ammonia into the ﬁltrate. Tubular secretion is also an important step in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acid base balance of body ﬂuids. 19.3 FUNCTION or THE TUBULEs Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): PCT is lined by simple cuboidal brush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption. Nearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytes and water are reabsorbed by this segment. PCT also helps to maintain the pH and ionic balance of the body ﬂuids by selective secretion of hydrogen ions, ammonia and potassium ions into the ﬁltrate and by absorption of HCOS‘ from it. Henle’s Loop: Reabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb. However, this region plays a signiﬁcant role in the maintenance of high osmolarity of medullary interstitial ﬂuid. The descending limb of loop of Henle is permeable to water but almost impermeable to electrolytes. This concentrates the filtrate as it moves down. The ascending limb is impermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively or passively. Therefore, as the concentrated ﬁltrate pass upward, it gets diluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary ﬂuid. Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Conditional reabsorption of Na+ and water takes place in this segment. DCT is also capable of reabsorption of HCOs‘ and selective secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions and NH3 to maintain the pH and sodium-potassium balance in blood.",1
1596,1316,"THE LIVING WORLD unicellular or multicellular. All plants, animals, fungi and microbes exhibit metabolism. The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in our body is metabolism. No non-living object exhibits metabolism. Metabolic reactions can be demonstrated outside the body in cell-free systems. An isolated metabolic reaction(s) outside the body of an organism, performed in a test tube is neither living nor non-living. Hence, while metabolism is a defining feature of all living organisms without exception, isolated metabolic reactions in vitro are not living things but surely living reactions. Hence, cellular organisation of the body is the deﬁning feature of life forms. Perhaps, the most obvious and technically complicated feature of all living organisms is this ability to sense their surroundings or environment and respond to these environmental stimuli which could be physical, chemical or biological. We sense our environment through our sense organs. Plants respond to external factors like light, water, temperature, other organisms, pollutants, etc. All organisms, from the prokaryotes to the most complex eukaryotes can sense and respond to environmental cues. Photoperiod affects reproduction in seasonal breeders, both plants and animals. All organisms handle chemicals entering their bodies. All organisms therefore, are ‘aware’ of their surroundings. Human being is the only organism who is aware of himself, i.e., has self-consciousness. Consciousness therefore, becomes the deﬁning property of living organisms. When it comes to human beings, it is all the more difficult to deﬁne the living state. We observe patients lying in coma in hospitals virtually supported by machines which replace heart and lungs. The patient is otherwise brain-dead. The patient has no self-consciousness. Are such patients who never come back to normal life, living or non-living? In higher classes, you will come to know that all living phenomena are due to underlying interactions. Properties of tissues are not present in the constituent cells but arise as a result of interactions among the constituent cells. Similarly, properties of cellular organelles are not present in the molecular constituents of the organelle but arise as a result of interactions among the molecular components comprising the organelle. These interactions result in emergent properties at a higher level of organisation. This phenomenon is true in the hierarchy of organisational complexity at all levels. Therefore, we can say that living organisms are self-replicating, evolving and self-regulating interactive systems capable of responding to external stimuli. Biologr is the story of life on earth. Biology is the story of evolution of living organisms on earth. All living organisms — present, past and future, are linked to one another by the sharing of the common genetic material, but to varying degrees.",1

Majority of the parasites harm the host; they may reduce the survival, growth and reproduction of the host and reduce its population density. They might render the host more vulnerable to predation by making it physically weak. Do you believe that an ideal parasite should be able to thrive within the host without harming it? Then why didn’t natural selection lead to the evolution of such totally harmless parasites? Parasites that feed on the external surface of the host organism are called ectoparasites. The most familiar examples of this group are the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many marine ﬁsh are infested with ectoparasitic copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant that is commonly found growing on hedge plants, has lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of evolution. It derives its nutrition from the host plant which it parasitises. The female mosquito is not considered a parasite, although it needs our blood for reproduction. Can you explain why? In contrast, endoparasites are those that live inside the host body at different sites (liver, kidney, lungs, red blood cells, etc.). The life cycles of endoparasites are more complex because of their extreme specialisation. Their morphological and anatomical features are greatly simpliﬁed while emphasising their reproductive potential. Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating example of parasitism in which the parasitic bird lays its eggs in the nest of its host and lets the host incubate them. During the course of evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have evolved to resemble the host’s egg in size and colour to reduce the chances of the host bird detecting the foreign eggs and ejecting them from the nest. Try to follow the movements of the cuckoo (koel) and the crow in your neighborhood park during the breeding season (spring to summer) and watch brood parasitism in action. Commensalism: This is the interaction in which one species beneﬁts and the other is neither harmed nor beneﬁted. An orchid growing as an epiphyte on a mango branch, and barnacles growing on the back of a whale beneﬁt while neither the mango tree nor the whale derives any apparent beneﬁt. The cattle egret and grazing cattle in close association, a sight you are most likely to catch if you live in farmed rural areas, is a classic example of commensalism. The egrets always forage close to where the cattle are grazing because the cattle, as they move, stir up and ﬂush out insects from the vegetation that otherwise might be difﬁcult for the egrets to ﬁnd and catch.

1599,553,"10. 11. This is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of the nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear matter. After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, E = m2, we cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of conservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that this principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is central to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a source of power. Using the principle, Q of a nuclear process [decay or reaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses. The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that exothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse or when a heavy nucleus undergoes ﬁssion into nuclei with intermediate mass. For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to overcome the coulomb potential barrier. That is why fusion requires very high temperatures. Although the binding energy (per nucleon) curve is smooth and slowly varying. it shows peaks at nuclides like 4He, 160 etc. This is considered as evidence of atom—like shell structure in nuclei. Electrons and positron are a particle—antiparticle pair. They are identical in mass; their charges are equal in magnitude and opposite. [It is found that when an electron and a positron come together, they annihilate each other giving energy in the form of gamma—ray photons.) In é’—decay [electron emission), the particle emitted along with electron is anti—neutrino (17). On the other hand, the particle emitted in [3”— decay [positron emission) is neutrino (v). Neutrino and anti—neutrino are a particle-antiparticle pair. There are anti particles associated with every particle. What should be antiproton which is the anti particle of the proton? A free neutron is unstable [n —> p + e‘ + 17). But a similar free proton decay is not possible. since a proton is (slightly) lighter than a neutron. Gamma emission usually follows alpha or beta emission. A nucleus in an excited (higher) state goes to a lower state by emitting a gamma photon. A nucleus may be left in an excited state after alpha or beta emission. Successive emission of gamma rays from the same nucleus [as in case of “M, Fig. 13.4) is a clear proof that nuclei also have discrete energy levels as do the atoms. Radioactivity is an indication of the instability of nuclei. Stability requires the ratio of neutron to proton to be around 1:1 for light nuclei. This ratio increases to about 3:2 for heavy nuclei. [More neutrons are required to overcome the effect of repulsion among the protons.) Nuclei which are away from the stability ratio, i.e., nuclei which have an excess of neutrons or protons are unstable. In fact. only about 10% of knon isotopes [of all elements), are stable. Others have been either artificially produced in the laboratory by bombarding a, p, d, n or other particles on targets of stable nuclear species or identified in astronomical observations of matter in the universe. 2019-20 Nuclei 461",0

Arrival of the disturbance at the neuron’s endings, or output zone, triggers events that may cause stimulation or inhibition of adjacent neurons and other cells (You will study the details in Chapter 2 1). 7.2 ORGAN AND ORGAN SYSTEM The basic tissues mentioned above organise to form organs which in turn associate to form organ systems in the multicellular organisms. Such an organisation is essential for more efficient and better coordinated activities of millions of cells constituting an organism. Each organ in our body is made of one or more type of tissues. For example, our heart consists of all the four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective, muscular and neural. We also notice, after some careful study that the complexity in organ and organ systems displays certain discernable trend. This discernable trend is called evolutionary trend (You will study the details in class XII). You are being introduced to morphology and anatomy of three organisms at different evolutionary levels to show their organisation and functioning. Morphology refers to study of form or externally visible features. In the case of plants or microbes, the term morphology precisely means only this. In case of animals this refers to the external appearance of the organs or parts of the body. The word anatomy conventionally is used for the study of morphology of internal organs in the animals. You will learn the morphology and anatomy of earthworm, cockroach and frog representing invertebrates and vertebrates. 7.3 EARTHWORM Earthworm is a reddish brown terrestrial invertebrate that inhabits the upper layer of the moist soil. During day time, they live in burrows made by boring and swallowing the soil. In the gardens, they can be traced by their faecal deposits known as worm castings. The common Indian earthworms are Pheretima and Lumbricus. 7 .3. 1 Morphology Earthworms have long cylindrical body. The body is divided into more than hundred short segments which are similar (metameres about 100- 120 in number). The dorsal surface of the body is marked by a dark median mid dorsal line (dorsal blood vessel) along the longitudinal axis of the body. The ventral surface is distinguished by the presence of genital openings (pores). Anterior end consists of the mouth and the prostomium, a lobe which serves as a covering for the mouth and as a wedge to force open cracks in the soil into which the earthworm may crawl. ’Ihe prostomium is sensory in function. The ﬁrst body segment is called the peristomium (buccal segment) which contains the mouth. In a mature worm, segments",1
1602,517,"468 l Physics and ﬂow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the solid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes /valves, the mobile electrons were obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to ﬂow in an evacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space is required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume low power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability. Even the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer monitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced by Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state electronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices was formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead sulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as detector of radio waves. In the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of semiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like junction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a 3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also be described. 14.2 CLASSIFICATION OF METALS, CONDUCTORS AND SEMICONDUCTORS On the basis of conductivity On the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity (6) or resistivity (p = 1 /o), the solids are broadly classified as: (i) Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity). p~ 10—2— 10‘89m a~ 102 — 108 S m-1 (ii) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate to metals and insulators. p~ 10-5— IOGQm o~ 105— 10*""3 S m-1 (iii) Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity). p ~ 1011 — 1019 O m 6 ~ 10‘11 — 10‘19 S m—1 The values of p and a given above are indicative of magnitude and could well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity are not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and semiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which will become clear as we go along in this chapter. Our interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which could be: (i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge (ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are: 0 Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc. 0 Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc. 0 Organic polymers: polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc. Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on elemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic 2019-20",0

1604,944,"BIOLOGY of complete nucleotide sequence of human genome during last decade has set in a new era of genomics. In the last section, the essentials of human genome sequencing and its consequences will also be discussed. Let us begin our discussion by ﬁrst understanding the structure of the most interesting molecule in the living system, that is, the DNA. In subsequent sections, we will understand that why it is the most abundant genetic material, and what its relationship is with RNA. 6. 1 THE DNA DNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides. The length of DNA is usually deﬁned as number of nucleotides (or a pair of nucleotide referred to as base pairs) present in it. This also is the characteristic of an organism. For example, a bacteriophage known as ch X174 has 5386 nucleotides, Bacteriophage lambda has 48502 base pairs (bp), Escherichia coli has 4.6 X 106 bp, and haploid content of human DNA is 3.3 X 109 bp. Let us discuss the structure of such a long polymer. 6. 1. 1 Structure of Polynucleotide Chain Let us recapitulate the chemical structure of a polynucleotide chain (DNA or RNA). A nucleotide has three components — a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a phosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases — Purines (Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine). Cytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in DNA. Uracil is present in RNA at the place of Thymine. A nitrogenous base is linked to the OH of l'C pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic linkage to form a nucleoside, such as adenosine or deoxyadenosine, guanosine or deoxyguanosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine and uridine or deoxythymidine. When a phosphate group is linked to OH of BIG of a nucleoside through phosphoester linkage, a corresponding nucleotide (or deoxynucleotide depending upon the type of sugar present) is formed. Two nucleotides are linked through 3,-5' phosphodiester linkage to form a dinucleotide. More nucleotides can be joined in such a manner to form a polynucleotide chain. A polymer thus formed has at one end a free 5’ phosphate is 3 ’ hydroxyl Figure 6.1 A Polynucleotide chain 2019—2020",1

Thus if photons with a continuous range of frequencies pass through a rarefied gas and then are analysed with a spectrometer, a series of dark spectral absorption lines appear in the continuous spectrum. The dark lines indicate the frequencies that have been absorbed by the atoms of the gas. The explanation of the hydrogen atom spectrum provided by Bohr’s model was a brilliant achievement, which greatly stimulated progress towards the modern quantum theory. In 1922, Bohr was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics. Example 12.6 Using the Rydberg formula, calculate the wavelengths of the first four spectral lines in the Lyman series of the hydrogen spectrum.

It states that the angular momentum of the electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantised (that is, Ln = nh/27t; n = 1, 2, 3 ...). Why should the angular momentum have only those values that are integral multiples of h/ 27:? The French physicist Louis de Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr proposed his model. We studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie’s hypothesis that material particles, such as electrons, also have awave nature. C. J. Davisson and L. H.

1607,384,Founders of Kinetic Theory of Gases James Clerk Maxwell (1831 — 1879). born in Edinburgh. Scotland. was among the greatest physicists of the nineteenth century. He derived the thermal velocity distribution of molecules in a gas and was among the first to obtain reliable estimates of molecular parameters from measurable quantities like viscosity. etc. Maxwell's greatest achievement was the unification of the laws of electricity and magnetism (discovered by Coulomb. Oersted. Ampere and Faraday) into a consistent set of equations now called Maxwell's equations. From these he arrived at the most important conclusion that light is an electromagnetic wave. Interestingly. Maxwell did not agree with the idea [strongly suggested by the Faraday's laws of electrolysis] that electricity was particulate in nature. Ludwig Boltzmann (1844 — 1906) born in Vienna. Austria. worked on the kinetic theory of gases independently of Mamvell. A firm advocate of atomism. that is basic to kinetic theory. Boltzmann provided a statistical interpretation of the Second Law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy. He is regarded as one of the founders of classical statistical mechanics. The proportionality constant connecting energy and temperature in kinetic theory is known as Boltzmann's constant in his honour.,0

Anatomically, the ear can be divided into three major sections called the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (Figure 2 1.7). The outer ear consists of the pinna and external _ Temporal bone auditory meatus (canal). “ The pinna collects the vibrations in the air which produce sound.

The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efﬁciency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. An Eustachian tube connects the middle ear cavity with the pharynx. The Eustachian tube helps in equalising the pressures on either sides of the ear drum. The ﬂuid-ﬁlled inner ear called labyrinth consists of two parts, the bony and the membranous labyrinths. The bony labyrinth is a series of channels. Inside these channels lies the membranous labyrinth, which is surrounded by a ﬂuid called perilymph. The membranous labyrinth is ﬁlled with a ﬂuid called endolymph. The coiled portion of the labyrinth is called cochlea.

What is (i) the direction of the force on the wall due to each ball? (ii) the ratio of the magnitudes of impulses imparted to the balls by the wall ’? (*0 (b) Fig. 5.6 Answer An instinctive answer to (i) might be that the force on the wall in case (a) is normal to the wall, while that in case (b) is inclined at 30° to the normal. This answer is wrong. The force on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases. How to find the force on the wall? The trick is to consider the force (or impulse) on the ball due to the wall using the second law, and then use the third law to answer (i). Let u be the speed of each ball before and after collision with the wall, and m the mass of each ball. Choose the x and y axes as shown in the ﬁgure, and consider the change in momentum of the ball in each case : Case (a) (px )Inltial = mu (pg )lnltlal = 0 (pX)ﬁna1=_mu (py)ﬁml =0 Impulse is the change in momentum vector. Therefore, x—component of impulse = — 2 m u y-component of impulse = O Impulse and force are in the same direction. Clearly, from above, the force on the ball due to the wall is normal to the wall, along the negative x-direction. Using Newton’s third law of motion, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x-direction. The 2019-20 magnitude of force cannot be ascertained since the small time taken for the collision has not been specified in the problem. Case (b) (px)initial = mucos 30° , (Py)mm = — Tl'lLl.Sll’1-30o (px)_/inal = —mucos30°, (py)ﬁm,, = — musin30° Note, while px changes sign after collision, py does not. Therefore, x—component of impulse = —2 m u cos 30° y-component of impulse = O The direction of impulse (and force) is the same as in (a) and is normal to the wall along the negative x direction. As before, using Newton’s third law, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x direction. The ratio of the magnitudes of the impulses imparted to the balls in (a) and (b) is 2mu/(2mucos30°)=l~l.2 ‘ J3 5.7 CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM The second and third laws of motion lead to an important consequence: the law of conservation of momentum. Take a familiar example. A bullet is fired from a gun. If the force on the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun by the bullet is —F, according to the third law. The two forces act for a common interval of time At. According to the second law, F At is the change in momentum of the bullet and — F At is the change in momentum of the gun. Since initially, both are at rest, the change in momentum equals the final momentum for each. Thus if pb is the momentum of the bullet after firing and p9 is the recoil momentum of the gun, p9 = —pb i.e. pb + p9 = 0. That is, the total momentum of the (bullet + gun) system is conserved. Thus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with no external force), mutual forces between pairs of particles in the system can cause momentum change in individual particles, but since the mutual forces for each pair are equal and opposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs and the total momentum remains unchanged. This fact is known as the law of conservation of momentum :",0

1617,814,"BIOLOGY Those who take drugs intravenously (direct injection into the vein using a needle and syringe), are much more likely to acquire serious infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B. The viruses, which are responsible for these diseases, are transferred from one person to another by sharing of infected needles and syringes. Both AIDS and Hepatitis B infections are chronic infections and ultimately fatal. Both can be transmitted through sexual contact or infected blood. The use of alcohol during adolescence may also have long-term effects. It could lead to heavy drinking in adulthood. The chronic use of drugs and alcohol damages nervous system and liver (cirrhosis). The use of drugs and alcohol during pregnancy is also known to adversely affect the foetus. Another misuse of drugs is what certain sportspersons do to enhance their performance. They (mis)use narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids, diuretics and certain hormones in sports to increase muscle strength and bulk and to promote aggressiveness and as a result increase athletic performance. The side-effects of the use of anabolic steroids in females include masculinisation (features like males), increased aggressiveness, mood swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycles, excessive hair growth on the face and body, enlargement of clitoris, deepening of voice. In males it includes acne, increased aggressiveness, mood swings, depression, reduction of size of the testicles, decreased sperm production, potential for kidney and liver dysfunction, breast enlargement, premature baldness, enlargement of the prostate gland. These effects may be permanent with prolonged use. In the adolescent male or female, severe facial and body acne, and premature closure of the growth centres of the long bones may result in stunted growth. 8.5.4 Prevention and Control The age-old adage of ‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true here also. It is also true that habits such as smoking, taking drug or alcohol are more likely to be taken up at a young age, more during adolescence. Hence, it is best to identify the situations that may push an adolescent towards use of drugs or alcohol, and to take remedial measures well in time. In this regard, the parents and the teachers have a special responsibility. Parenting that combines with high levels of nurturance and consistent discipline, has been associated with lowered risk of substance (alcohol/ drugs / tobacco) abuse. Some of the measures mentioned here would be particularly useful for prevention and control of alcohol and drugs abuse among adolescents (i) Avoid undue peer pressure - Every child has his / her own choice and personality, which should be respected and nurtured. A child should not be pushed unduly to perform beyond his / her threshold limits; be it studies, sports or other activities. 2019—2020",1
1618,677,"SUMMARY Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal amount of positive and negative charges. In Thomson’s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges with electrons embedded in it. In Rutherford’s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive charge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand the size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the structure of atom: [a] It predicts that atoms are unstable because the accelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into the nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot explain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements. Atoms of each element are stable and emit characteristic spectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines termed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the atomic structure. The atomic hydrogen emits a line spectrum consisting of various series. The frequency of any line in a series can be expressed as a difference of two terms; 1 l Lyman series: v: Rc(1—2——2) : n= 2, 3, 4,... n . l l Balmer series: v: Rc[2—2——2) ; n = 3, 4. 5,... n l l Paschen series: v: Rc[3—2——2] : n = 4, 5, 6,... n l l Brackett series: v: Rc(4—z——2) ; n = 5, 6, 7,... n . l l Pfund series: v: Rc[5—2——2) : n = 6, 7, 8,... n To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability of atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic [single elctron] atoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of quantum mechanics: [a] In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits [called stationary orbits] without the emission of radiant energl. (b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of h/2n. [Bohr’s quantisation condition.) That is L = nh/ 2n, where n is an integer called a quantum number. [c] The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition from one of its specified non—radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. The frequency (v) of the emitted photon is then given by hv =Ei—Ef An atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits, in which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher value of n.

In return for the favour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae. Orchids show a bewildering diversity of ﬂoral patterns many of which have evolved to attract the right pollinator insect (bees and bumblebees) and ensure guaranteed pollination by it (Figure l 3.8). Not all orchids offer rewards. The Mediterranean orchid Ophrys employs ‘sexual deceit’ to get pollination done by a species of bee. One petal of its ﬂower bears an uncanny resemblance to the female of the bee in size, colour and markings. The male bee is attracted to what it perceives as a female, ‘pseudocopulates’ with the ﬂower, and during that process is dusted with pollen from the ﬂower. When this same bee ‘pseudocopulates’ with another ﬂower, it transfers pollen to it and thus, pollinates the ﬂower. Here you can see how co-evolution operates. If the female bee’s colour patterns change even slightly for any reason during evolution, pollination success will be reduced unless the orchid ﬂower co-evolves to maintain the resemblance of its petal to the female bee. SUMMARY 238 wmv As a branch of biology, Ecologr is the study of the relationships of living organisms with the abiotic (physico-chemical factors) and biotic components (other species) of their environment. It is concerned with four levels of biological organisation-organisms, populations, communities and biomes. Temperature, light, water and soil are the most important physical factors of the environment to which the organisms are adapted in various ways. Maintenance of a constant internal environment (homeostasis) by the organisms contributes to optimal performance, but only some organisms (regulators) are capable of homeostasis in the face of changing external environment. Others either partially regulate their internal environment or simply conform. A few other species have evolved adaptations to avoid unfavourable conditions in space (migration) or in time (aestivation, hibernation, and diapause). Evolutionary changes through natural selection take place at the population level and hence, population ecology is an important area of ecology. A population is a group of individuals of a given species sharing or competing for similar resources in a defined geographical area. Populations have attributes that individual organisms do not- birth rates and death rates, sex ratio and age 2019—2020",1

In this case the contribution of the internal forces to the total torque on the system is zero, since the torque resulting from each action- reaction pair of forces is zero.

Eq. (7.28 b) is the generalisation of the single particle case of Eq. (7.23) to a system of particles. Note that when we have only one particle, there are no internal forces or torques. Eq.(7 .28 b) is the rotational analogue of (7.28 b) —:Fext (7-17) Note that like Eq.(7 .17), Eq.(7.28b) holds good for any system of particles, whether it is a rigid body or its individual particles have all kinds of internal motion. Conservation of angular momentum If text: 0, Eq. (7 .28b) reduces to d_L = 0 dt or L = constant. (7 .29a) Thus, if the total external torque on a system of particles is zero, then the total angular momentum of the system is conserved, i.e. remains constant. Eq. (7 .29a) is equivalent to three scalar equations, LX=K1, Ly =K2 and LZ=K3 (7.29 b) Here K1, K2 and K3 are constants; LX, Ly and L2 are the components of the total angular momentum vector L along the x,y and z axes respectively. The statement that the total angular momentum is conserved means that each of these three components is conserved. Eq. (7.29a) is the rotational analogue of Eq. (7 . 18a), i.e. the conservation law of the total linear momentum for a system of particles. Like Eq. (7 .18a), it has applications in many practical situations.

1623,50,"40 PHYSICS a rectangular coordinate system consisting of three mutually perpenducular axes, labelled X-, Y-, and Z- axes. The point of intersection of these three axes is called origin (0) and serves as the reference point. The coordinates (x, y. z) of an object describe the position of the object with respect to this coordinate system. To measure time, we position a clock in this system. This coordinate system along with a clock constitutes a frame of reference. If one or more coordinates of an object change with time, we say that the object is in motion. Otherwise, the object is said to be at rest with respect to this frame of reference. The choice of a set of axes in a frame of reference depends upon the situation. For example, for describing motion in one dimension, we need only one axis. To describe motion in two/ three dimensions, we need a set of two/ three axes. Description of an event depends on the frame of reference chosen for the description. For example, when you say that a car is moving on a road, you are describing the car with respect to a frame of reference attached to you or to the ground. But with respect to a frame of reference attached with a person sitting in the car, the car is at rest. To describe motion along a straight line, we can choose an axis, say X-axis, so that it coincides with the path of the object. We then measure the position of the object with reference to a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown in Fig. 3.1. Positions to the right of O are taken as positive and to the left of O, as negative. Following this convention, the position coordinates of point P and Q in Fig. 3.1 are +360 m and +240 m. Similarly, the position coordinate of point R is —120 m. Path length Consider the motion of a car along a straight line. We choose the x-axis such that it coincides R O with the path of the car’s motion and origin of the axis as the point from where the car started moving, i.e. the carwas at x= O at t= 0 (Fig. 3.1). Let P, Q and R represent the positions of the car at different instants of time. Consider two cases of motion. In the first case, the car moves from O to P. Then the distance moved by the car is OP = +360 m. This distance is called the path length traversed by the car. In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q. During this course of motion, the path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m + (+120 m) = + 480 m. Path length is a scalar quantity — a quantity that has a magnitude only and no direction (see Chapter 4). Displacement It is useful to define another quantity displacement as the change in position. Let x1 and x2 be the positions of an object at time t1 and t2. Then its displacement, denoted by Ax, in time At = (t2 - t1), is given by the difference between the final and initial positions : Ax = x2— x1 (We use the Greek letter delta (A) to denote a change in a quantity.) If x2 > x1, Ax is positive; and if x2 < x1, Ax is negative. Displacement has both magnitude and direction. Such quantities are represented by vectors. You will read about vectors in the next chapter. Presently, we are dealing with motion along a straight line (also called rectilinear motion) only. In one-dimensional motion, there are only two directions (backward and forward, upward and downward) in which an object can move, and these two directions can easily be specified by + and — signs. For example, displacement of the car in moving from O to P is : Ax=x2—x1 = (+360 m) —Om= +360m The displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and is directed in the positive x direction as indicated by the + sign. Similarly, the displacement of the car from P to Q is 240 m— 360 m = — 120 m.

1624,873,"REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS In some algae the two gametes are so similar in appearance that it is not possible to categorise them into male and female gametes. They are hence called homogametes (isogametes) (Figure 1.5a). However, in a majority of sexually reproducing organisms the gametes produced are of two morphologically distinct types (heterogametes). In such organisms the male gamete is called the antherozoid or sperm and the female gamete is called the egg or ovum (Figure1.5 b, c). Sexuality in organisms: Sexual reproduction in organisms generally involves the fusion of gametes from two different individuals. But this is not always true. From your recollection of examples studied in Class XI, can you identify cases where self-fertilisation is observed? Of course, citing such examples in plants is easy. Plants may have both male and female reproductive structures in the same plant (bisexual) (Figure 1.6 c, e) or on different plants (unisexual) (Figure 1.6 d). In several fungi and plants, terms such as homothallic and monoecious are used to denote the bisexual condition and heterothallic and dioecious are the terms used to describe unisexual condition. In ﬂowering plants, the unisexual male ﬂower is staminate, i.e., bearing stamens, while the female is pistillate or bearing pistils. In some ﬂowering plants, both male and female ﬂowers may be present on the same individual (monoecious) or on separate individuals (dioecious). Some examples of monoecious plants are cucurbits and coconuts and of dioecious plants are papaya and date palm. Name the type of gametes that are formed in staminate and pistillate ﬂowers. But what about animals? Are individuals of all species either male or female (unisexual)? Or are there species which possess both the reproductive organs (bisexual)? You probably can make a list of several unisexual animal species. Earthworms, (Figure 1.6 a) sponge, tapeworm and leech, typical examples of bisexual animals that possess both male and female reproductive organs, are hermaphrodites. Cockroach (Figure 1.6b) is an example of a unisexual species. Cell division during gamete formation : Gametes in all heterogametic species are of two types namely, male and female. Gametes are haploid though the parent plant body from which they arise may be either haploid or diploid. A haploid parent produces gametes by mitotic division. Does this mean that meiosis never occurs in organisms that are haploid? Carefully examine the ﬂow charts of life cycles of algae that you have studied in Class XI (Chapter 3) to get a suitable answer. Several organisms belonging to monera, fungi, algae and bryophytes have haploid plant body, but in organisms belonging to pteridophytes, gymnosperms, angiosperms and most of the animals including human beings, the parental body is diploid. It is obvious that meiosis, the reduction division, has to occur if a diploid body has to produce haploid gametes. 2019-2020",1

If one were to make a list of biomolecules, such a list would have thousands of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, etc. For reasons that are given in section 9. 10, we can call these biomolecules as ‘metabolites’. In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such categories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. These are called primary metabolites. However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells, one would see thousands of compounds other than these called primary metabolites, e. g. alkaloids, ﬂavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices.

The acid insoluble fraction, has only four types of organic compounds i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. These classes of compounds with the exception of lipids, have molecular weights in the range of ten thousand daltons and above. For this very reason, biomolecules, i.e., chemical compounds found in living organisms are of two types. One, those which have molecular weights less than one thousand dalton and are usually referred to as micromolecules or simply biomolecules while those which are found in the acid insoluble fraction are called macromolecules or biomacromolecules. The molecules in the insoluble fraction with the exception of lipids are polymeric substances. Then why do lipids, whose molecular weights do not exceed 800 Da, come under acid insoluble fraction, i.e., macromolecular fraction? Lipids are indeed small molecular weight",1

1629,935,"234 (ii) BIOLOGY predators. The Monarch butterﬂy is highly distasteful to its predator (bird) because of a special chemical present in its body. Interestingly, the butterﬂy acquires this chemical during its caterpillar stage by feeding on a poisonous weed. For plants, herbivores are the predators. Nearly 25 per cent of all insects are known to be phytophagous (feeding on plant sap and other parts of plants). The problem is particularly severe for plants because, unlike animals, they cannot run away from their predators. Plants therefore have evolved an astonishing variety of morphological and chemical defences against herbivores. Thorns (Acacia, Cactus) are the most common morphological means of defence. Many plants produce and store chemicals that make the herbivore sick when they are eaten, inhibit feeding or digestion, disrupt its reproduction or even kill it. You must have seen the weed Calotropis growing in abandoned fields. The plant produces highly poisonous cardiac glycosides and that is why you never see any cattle or goats browsing on this plant. Awide variety of chemical substances that we extract from plants on a commercial scale (nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc.,) are produced by them actually as defences against grazers and browsers. Competition: When Darwin spoke of the struggle for existence and survival of the ﬁttest in nature, he was convinced that interspeciﬁc competition is a potent force in organic evolution. It is generally believed that competition occurs when closely related species compete for the same resources that are limiting, but this is not entirely true. Firstly, totally unrelated species could also compete for the same resource. For instance, in some shallow South American lakes, Visiting ﬂamingoes and resident fishes compete for their common food, the zooplankton in the lake. Secondly, resources need not be limiting for competition to occur; in interference competition, the feeding efﬁciency of one species might be reduced due to the interfering and inhibitory presence of the other species, even if resources (food and space) are abundant. Therefore, competition is best deﬁned as a process in which the ﬁtness of one species (measured in terms of its ‘r’ the intrinsic rate of increase) is signiﬁcantly lower in the presence of another species. It is relatively easy to demonstrate in laboratory experiments, as Gause and other experimental ecologists did, when resources are limited the competitively superior species will eventually eliminate the other species, but evidence for such competitive exclusion occurring in nature is not always conclusive. Strong and persuasive circumstantial evidence does exist however in some cases. The Abingdon tortoise in Galapagos Islands became extinct within a decade after goats were introduced on the island, apparently due to the greater browsing efﬁciency of the goats.

1631,337,"456 l Physics In the first reaction, two protons combine to form a deuteron and a positron with a release of 0.42 MeV energy. In reaction [13.29(b)], two deuterons combine to form the light isotope of helium. In reaction (13.290), two deuterons combine to form a triton and a proton. For fusion to take place, the two nuclei must come close enough so that attractive short-range nuclear force is able to affect them. However, since they are both positively charged particles, they experience coulomb repulsion. They, therefore, must have enough energy to overcome this coulomb barrier. The height of the barrier depends on the charges and radii of the two interacting nuclei. It can be shown, for example, that the barrier height for two protons is ~ 400 keV, and is higher for nuclei with higher charges. We can estimate the temperature at which two protons in a proton gas would (averagely) have enough energy to overcome the coulomb barrier: (3/2)): T = K 2 400 keV, which gives T ~ 3 x 109 K. When fusion is achieved by raising the temperature of the system so that particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb repulsive behaviour, it is called thermonuclear fusion. Thermonuclear fusion is the source of energy output in the interior of stars. The interior of the sun has a temperature of l.5><107 K, which is considerably less than the estimated temperature required for fusion of particles of average energy. Clearly, fusion in the sun involves protons whose energies are much above the average energy. The fusion reaction in the sun is a multi-step process in which the hydrogen is burned into helium. Thus, the fuel in the sun is the hydrogen in its core. The proton-proton (p, p) cycle by which this occurs is represented by the following sets of reactions: }H+ }H—> 21H + e+ + v + 0.42 MeV (i) e+ + e‘ —> y+ y+ 1.02 MeV (ii) §H+ }H a 3He+ y+ 5.49 MeV (iii) gHe +3He —>‘;He+}H+}H+ 12.86 MeV (iv) (13.30) For the fourth reaction to occur, the first three reactions must occur twice, in which case two light helium nuclei unite to form ordinary helium nucleus. If we consider the combination 2(i) + 2(ii) + 2(iii) +(iv), the net effect is 41H+2e‘ —> §He+2v+6y+26.7MeV or (4}H+4e‘)—>(;He+2e—)+2v+6y+26.7Mev (13.31) Thus, four hydrogen atoms combine to form an :He atom with a release of 26.7 MeV of energy. Helium is not the only element that can be synthesized in the interior of a star. As the hydrogen in the core gets depleted and becomes helium, the core starts to cool.

Bark is a non-technical term that refers to all tissues exterior to the vascular cambium, therefore including secondary phloem. Bark refers to a number of tissue types, viz., periderm and secondary phloem. Bark that is formed early in the season is called early or soft bark. Towards the end of the season, late or hard bark is formed. Name the various kinds of cell layers which constitute the bark. (a) At certain regions, the phellogen cuts off closely arranged parenchymatous cells on the outer side instead of cork cells. These parenchymatous cells soon rupture the epidermis, forming a lens- shaped openings called lenticels.

1633,192,"Electric Charges and Fields at that point. The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is called a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a source charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q must remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought at any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical force due to q and will tend to move. Away out of this difficulty is to make q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the ratio F / q is finite and defines the electric field: E =11m£§j (1.9) an q A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed in the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces! This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice. When we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a charged planar sheet (Section 1.1 5), the charges on the sheet are held to their locations by the forces due to the unspeciﬁed charged constituents inside the sheet. (ii) Note that the electric field E due to Q, though deﬁned operationally in terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because F is proportional to q, so the ratio F/ q does not depend on q. The force F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular location of charge q which may take any value in the space around the charge Q. Thus, the electric ﬁeld E due to Q is also dependent on the space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over the space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at every point in three-dimensional space. (iii) For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially outwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is negative, the electric ﬁeld vector, at each point, points radially inwards. (iv) Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q depends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q, the magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the distance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude of its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E due to a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its centre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry. 1.8. 1 Electric ﬁeld due to a system of charges Consider a system of charges q1, q2, qn with position vectors r1, r2, rn relative to some origin 0. Like the electric field at a point in space due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the system of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit test charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original positions of charges q1, q2, qn. We can use Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by position vector 1'. 2019-20 19",0
1634,1162,"40 BIOLOGY 3.5 ANGIOSPERMS Unlike the gymnosperms where the ovules are naked, in the angiosperms or ﬂowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed in specialised structures called ﬂowers. In angiosperms, the seeds are enclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of plants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from the smallest Wolﬂ‘ia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provide us with food, fodder, fuel, medicines and several other commercially important products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5). The dicotyledons are characterised by seeds having two cotyledons, reticulate venations in leaves, and tetramerous or pentamerous ﬂowers, i.e., having four or five members in each ﬂoral whorls. The monocotyledons on the other hand are characterised by single cotyledonous seeds, parallel venation in leaves, and trimerous ﬂowers having three members in each ﬂoral whorls. The male sex organ in a ﬂower is the stamen. Each stamen consists of a slender ﬁlament with an anther at the tip. Within the anthers, the pollen mother cell divide by meiosis to produce microspores which matures into pollen grains. The female sex organ in a ﬂower is the pistil. Pistil consists of a swollen ovary at its base, a long slender style and stigma. Inside the ovary, ovules are present. Generally each ovule has a megaspore mother cell that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid megaspores. Three of them degenerate and one divide to form the embryo sac. Each embryo-sac has a three-celled egg apparatus — one egg cell and two synergids, three antipodal cells and two polar nuclei.

The Southern Atlantic Sea Route This sea route is another important one across the Atlantic Ocean which connects West European and West African countries with Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay in South America. The traffic is far less on this route because of the limited development and population in South America and Africa.

1636,756,"66 PHYSICS just as the ordinary numbers*. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m = 3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar. Take another example: the maximum and minimum temperatures on a particular day are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively. Then, the difference between the two temperatures is 1 1.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of 2.7 kg, then its volume is 10'3 m3 (a scalar) and its density is 2.7x103 kg m'3 (a scalar). A vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the triangle law of addition or equivalently the parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say U. Thus, both v and U represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by |v| = v. Thus, a vector is represented by a bold face, e.g. byA, a, p, q, r, x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light face A, a, p, q, r, x, y. 4.2. 1 Position and Displacement Vectors To describe the position of an object moving in a plane, we need to choose a convenient point, say 0 as origin. Let P and P’ be the positions of the object at time tand t’, respectively [Fig. 4. 1(a)]. We join 0 and P by a straight line. Then, OP is the position vector of the object at time t. An arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is represented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r. Point P’ is represented by another position vector, OP’ denoted by r’. The length of the vector r represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from 0. If the object moves from P to P’, the vector PP’ (with tail at P and tip at P’) is called the displacement vector corresponding to motion from point P (at time t) to point P’ (at time t’). (b) Fig. 4.1 [a] Position and displacement vectors. (b) Displacement vector P9 and different courses of motion. It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, in Fig. 4.1(b), given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same PQ for different paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ. Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points. This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussing motion along a straight line. 4.2.2 Equality of Vectors Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and only if, they have the same magnitude and the same direction.** Figure 4.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and B. We can easily check their equality. Shift B parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that of A, i.e. Q coincides with 0. Then, since their tips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are said to be equal. In general, equality is indicated * Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply and divide scalars of different units. ** In our study, vectors do not have ﬁxed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector unchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors. 2019-20",0

To summarise the discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can be defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq. (14.4) for displacement or by Eq. (14. 13) that gives its force law. Going from Eq. (14.4) to Eq. (14.13) required us to differentiate two times. Likewise, by integrating the force law Eq. (14.13) two times, we can get back Eq. (14.4). Note that the force in Eq. (14.13) is linearly proportional to At). A particle oscillating under such a force is, therefore, calling a linear harmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force may contain small additional terms proportional to x2, )8, etc. These then are called non-linear oscillators.

(iv) Electric power meters: The shiny metal disc in the electric power meter (analogue type) rotates due to the eddy currents. Electric currents are induced in the disc by magnetic ﬁelds produced by sinusoidally varying currents in a coil. You can observe the rotating shiny disc in the power meter of your house. ELECTROMAGNETIC DAMPING Take two hollow thin cylindrical pipes of equal internal diameters made of aluminium and PVC, respectively. Fix them vertically with clamps on retort stands. Take a small cylinderical magnet having diameter slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the pipes and drop it through each pipe in such a way that the magnet does not touch the sides of the pipes during its fall. You will observe that the magnet dropped through the PVC pipe takes the same time to come out of the pipe as it would take when dropped through the same height without the pipe. Note the time it takes to come out of the pipe in each case. You will see that the magnet takes much longer time in the case of aluminium pipe. Why is it so? It is due to the eddy currents that are generated in the aluminium pipe which oppose the change in magnetic ﬂux, i.e., the motion of the magnet. The retarding force due to the eddy currents inhibits the motion of the magnet. Such phenomena are referred to as electromagnetic damping. Note that eddy currents are not generated in PVC pipe as its material is an insulator whereas aluminium is a conductor. 6.9 INDUCTANCE An electric current can be induced in a coil by ﬂux change produced by another coil in its vicinity or ﬂux change produced by the same coil.

Depreciation is a non-cash item and hence, Rs 5,000 charged as depreciation does not result in any cash ﬂow. Therefore, this amount must be added back to the net proﬁt. 2. Finance costs of Rs 5,000 is a cash outﬂow on account of ﬁnancing activity. Therefore, this amount must also be added back to net proﬁt while calculating cash ﬂows from operating activities. This amount of ﬁnance cost will be shown as an outflow under the head of ﬁnancing activities. 3. Other income includes proﬁt on sale of land: It is cash inﬂow from investing activity.

The position of the object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin. For motion in a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as negative. Path length is defined as the total length of the path traversed by an object. Displacement is the change in position 2 Ax = x2 — x1. Path length is greater or equal to the magnitude of the displacement between the same points. An object is said to be in uniform motion in a straight line if its displacement is equal in equal intervals of time. Otherwise, the motion is said to be non—uniform. Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval in which the displacement occurs : _ Ax v 2 _ At On an x—t graph, the average velocity over a time interval is the slope of the line connecting the initial and final positions corresponding to that interval. Average Speed is the ratio of total path length traversed and the corresponding time interval. The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval.

Now, consider a point mass m at a depth d below the surface of the earth (Fig. 8.8(b)), so that its distance from the centre of the earth is (RE — d) as shown in the figure. The earth can be thought of as being composed of a smaller sphere of radius (RE — d) and a spherical shell of thickness d. The force on m due to the outer shell of thickness d is zero because the result quoted in the previous section. As far as the smaller sphere of radius (RE — d ) is concerned, the point mass is outside it and hence according to the result quoted earlier, the force due to this smaller sphere is just as if the entire mass of the smaller sphere is concentrated at the centre. If Ms is the mass of the smaller sphere, then, Ms/ME=(RE—d)3 /RE3 (8.16) Since mass of a sphere is proportional to be cube of its radius. Earth's surface (b) Fig. 8.8 (b) g at a depth d. In this case only the smaller sphere of radius (RE—d) contributes to 9. Thus the force on the point mass is F(d) = GMsm/ (RE—d)2 (8.17) Substituting for MS from above , we get F(d) = GMEm(RE—d)/ RE3 (8.18) and hence the acceleration due to gravity at a depth d, Fd g(d)= ( )is g(d)=—F(d)=GR§E (RE-d) m RE R —d :9 :2 =g(1—d/RE) (8.19) Thus, as we go down below earth’s surface, the acceleration due gravity decreases by a factor (l—d/RE).The remarkable thing about acceleration due to earth’s gravity is that it is maximum on its surface decreasing whether you go up or down. 8.7 GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY We had discussed earlier the notion of potential energy as being the energy stored in the body at its given position. If the position of the particle changes on account of forces acting on it, then the change in its potential energy is just the amount of work done on the body by the force. As we had discussed earlier, forces for which the work done is independent of the path are the conservative forces. The force of gravity is a conservative force and we can calculate the potential energy of a body arising out of this force, called the gravitational potential energy. Consider points close to the surface of earth, at distances from the surface much smaller than the radius of the earth. In such cases, the force of gravity is practically a constant equal to mg, directed towards the centre of the earth. If we consider a point at a height h1 from the surface of the earth and another point vertically above it at a height h,2 from the surface, the work done in lifting the particle of mass m from the first to the second position is denoted by W12 W12 = Force X displacement = mg (h, — h) (8.20) 2019-20",0

First, we assume 6} that the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb Q the original configuration, namely the charge Q at the origin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some FIGURE 2_1 A test charge (1 (> 0) is unspeciﬁed force). Second, inbringing the charge qfrom moved from the point R to the R to P, we apply an external force Fext just enough to point P against the repulsive counter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fem: —FE). force on it by the charge Q (> O) This means there is no net force on or acceleration of placed at the origin. the charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is brought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In this situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work done by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential energy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the electric force will take the charge away from Q — the stored energy (potential energy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a way that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved. Thus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is = —IFE-dr (2-1) This work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored as potential energy. At every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a certain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential energy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points R and P. Thus, potential energy difference AU 2 UP —UR = WRP (2.2) (Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric force and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., —WRP.) Therefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between two points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving (without accelerating) charge q from one point to another for electric field of any arbitrary charge configuration. Two important comments may be made at this stage: (i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions of the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in moving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial and the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from one point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a conservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be meaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence of work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the 52 Coulomb’s law. We omit this proof here. 2019-20",0

Insulin also stimulates conversion of glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells. The glucose homeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two — insulin and glucagons. Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes mellitus which is associated with loss of glucose through urine and formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy. 22.2.9 Testis A pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac (outside abdomen) of male individuals (Figure 22.1). Testis performs dual functions as a primary sex organ as well as an endocrine gland. Testis is composed of seminiferous tubules and stromal or interstitial tissue. The Leydig cells or interstitial cells, which are present in the intertubular spaces produce a group of hormones called androgens mainly testosterone. Androgens regulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscular growth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch of voice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of sperrnatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the central neural system and inﬂuence the male sexual behaviour (libido). These hormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism. 22.2. 10 Ovary Females have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 22.1). Ovary is the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each menstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroid hormones called estrogen and progesterone. Ovary is composed of ovarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised and secreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, the ruptured follicle is converted to a structure called corpus luteum, which secretes mainly progesterone. Estrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth and activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing",1

1652,1070,"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS channel of the CFO of the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists of two parts: one called the CFO is embedded in the thylakoid membrane and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF1 and protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough energy to cause a conformational change in the CF1 particle of the ATP synthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy- packed ATP. Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a membrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within the thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of protons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate ATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP. Along with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the ATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic reaction taking place in the stroma, responsible for ﬁxing 002, and synthesis of sugars. 13.7 WHERE ARE THE ATP AND NADPH USED? We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and 02. Of these 02 diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO2 and H20. You may wonder how this could be veriﬁed; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again. Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark reaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves. Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. We saw earlier that CO2 is combined with H20 to produce (CH20)n or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to ﬁnd out how this reaction proceeded, or rather what was the ﬁrst product formed when CO2 is taken into a reaction or ﬁxed. Just after world war 11, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneﬁcial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the ﬁrst CO2 ﬁxation product was a 3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The ﬁrst product identiﬁed was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA.

Tissue matching, blood group matching are essential before undertaking any graft / transplant and even after this the patient has to take immuno—suppresants all his / her life. The body is able to differentiate ‘self’ and ‘nonself and the cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the graft rejection. 8.2.3 Active and Passive Immunity When a host is exposed to antigens, which may be in the form of living or dead microbes or other proteins, antibodies are produced in the host body. This type of immunity is called active immunity. Active immunity is slow and takes time to give its full effective response. Injecting the microbes deliberately during immunisation or infectious organisms gaining access into body during natural infection induce active immunity. When ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect the body against foreign agents, it is called passive immunity. Do you know why mother’s milk is considered very essential for the new- born infant? The yellowish ﬂuid colostrum secreted by mother during the initial days of lactation has abundant antibodies ﬂgA) to protect the infant. The foetus also receives some antibodies from their mother, through the placenta during pregnancy. These are some examples of passive immunity. 8.2.4 Vaccination and Immunisation The principle of immunisation or vaccination is based on the property of ‘memory’ of the immune system. In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic proteins of pathogen or inactivated / weakened pathogen (vaccine) are introduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against these antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual infection. The vaccines also generate memory — B and T-cells that recognise the pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and overwhelm the invaders with a massive production of antibodies. If a person is infected with some deadly microbes to which quick immune response is required as in tetanus, we need to directly inject the preformed antibodies, or antitoxin (a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin). Even in cases of snakebites, the injection which is given to the patients, contain preformed antibodies against the snake venom. This type of immunisation is called passive immunisation. Recombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic polypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast. Vaccines produced using this approach allow large scale production and hence greater availability for immunisation, e. g., hepatitis B vaccine produced from yeast. 2019—2020",1

In oviparous animals like reptiles and birds, the fertilised eggs covered by hard calcareous shell are laid in a safe place in the environment; after a period of incubation young ones hatch out. On the other hand, in Viviparous animals (maj ority of mammals including human beings), the zygote develops into a young one inside the body of the female organism. After attaining a certain stage of growth, the young ones are delivered out of the body of the female organism. Because of proper embryonic care and protection, the chances of survival of young ones is greater in Viviparous organisms. In ﬂowering plants, the zygote is formed inside the ovule. After fertilisation the sepals, petals and stamens of the ﬂower wither and fall off. Can you name a plant in which the sepals remain attached? The pistil however, remains attached to the plant. The zygote develops into the embryo and the ovules develop into the seed. The ovary develops into the fruit which develops a thick wall called pericarp that is protective in function (Figure 1.8).

Reproduction in organisms can be broadly classiﬁed into asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion of gametes. It is common in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation such as the fungi, algae and some invertebrate animals. The offspring formed by asexual reproduction are identical and can be referred to as clones. Zoospores, conidia, etc., are the most common asexual structures formed in several algae and fungi. Budding and gemmule formation are the common asexual methods seen in lower animals. Prokaryotes and unicellular organisms reproduce asexually by cell division or binary fission of the parent cell.

Placental mammals in Australia also exhibit adaptive radiation in evolving into varieties of such placental mammals each of which appears to be ‘similar’ to a corresponding marsupial (e.g., Placental wolf and Tasmanian wolf-marsupial). (Figure 7. 7) . 7.5 BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION Evolution by natural selection, in a true sense would have started when cellular forms of life with differences in metabolic capability originated on earth. The essence of Darwinian theory about evolution is natural selection. The rate of My QM appearance of new forms is linked to the life cycle 31):?th fuscus ‘ or the life span. Microbes that divide fast have the ability to multiply and become millions of individuals within hours. A colony of bacteria (say A) growing on a given medium has built-in variation in terms of ability to utilise a feed component. A change in the medium composition would bring out only that part of the population (say B) that can survive under the new conditions. In due course of time this variant population outgrows the others and appears as new species. This would happen within days. For the same thing to happen in a ﬁsh or fowl would take million of years as life spans of these animals are in years. Here we say that ﬁtness of B is better than that of A under the new conditions. Nature selects for ﬁtness. Figure 7.7 Picture showing convergent evolution of Australian Marsupials and placental mammals One must remember that the so-called ﬁtness is based on characteristics which are inherited. Hence, there must be a genetic basis for getting selected and to evolve. Another way of saying the same thing is that some organisms are better 1 3 4 adapted to survive in an otherwise hostile environment. Adaptive ability is inherited. It has a genetic basis. Fitness is the end result of the ability to adapt and get selected by nature. Branching descent and natural selection are the two key concepts of Darwinian Theory of Evolution (Figures 7.7 and 7.8). Even before Darwin, a French naturalist Lamarck had said that evolution of life forms had occurred but driven by use and disuse of 2019-2020",1

You may easily show that the principle of moment holds even when the parallel forces F1 and F2 are not perpendicular, but act at some angle, to the lever. 7.8.2 Centre of gravity Many of you may have the experience of balancing your notebook on the tip of a finger. Figure 7 .24 illustrates a similar experiment that you can easily perform. Take an irregular- shaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow tipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial and error a point G on the cardboard where it can be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The cardboard remains horizontal in this position.) This point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG) of the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides a vertically upward force due to which the cardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As shown in the Fig. 7 .24, the reaction of the tip is equal and opposite to Mg and hence the cardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so, due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and fall. There are torques on the card board due to the forces of gravity like mlg, ng etc, acting on the individual particles that make up the cardboard. Fig. 7.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a pencil. The point of support, G, is the centre of gravity. The CG of the cardboard is so located that the total torque on it due to the forces mg, mg . etc. is zero. If ri is the position vector of the ith particle of an extended body with respect to its CG, then the torque about the CG, due to the force of gravity on the particle is It: riX mg. The total gravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e. tg=Zti=Zrixmig=0 (7.33) We may therefore, define the CG of a body as that point where the total gravitational torque on the body is zero. We notice that in Eq. (7 .33), g is the same for all particles, and hence it comes out of the summation. This gives, since g is non-zero, Z mirl. = 0. Remember that the position vectors (1"",) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in accordance with the reasoning given below Eq. (7.4a) in Sec. 7 .2, if the sum is zero, the origin must be the centre of mass of the body. Thus, the centre of gravity of the body coincides with the centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity- free space. We note that this is true because the body being small, g does not Fig. 7.25 Determining the centre of gravity of a body of irregular shape.

This means that there is a pressure difference between the two sides of the top surface. This is given by (P.- — Pa) =(2S/ r) = 2S/(a sec 6) = (2S/a) cos 0 (10.29) Thus the pressure of the water inside the tube, just at the meniscus (air—water interface) is less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider the two points A and B in Fig. 10.21(a). They must be at the same pressure, namely P0+ hpg=Pi=PA (10.30) where p is the density of water and h is called the capillary rise [Fig. 10.2 1(a)]. Using Eq. (10.29) and (10.30) we have hpg=(Pi—P0)=(2Scos0)/a (10.31) The discussion here, and the Eqs. (10.26) and (10.27) make it clear that the capillary rise is due to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller a. Typically it is of the order of a few cm for fine capillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using the value of surface tension for water (Table 10.3), we find that h=2S/(pga) = 2X(0.073 N m'l) (103 kgm'3) (9.8 ms'2)(5 X 10'4 m) = 2.98 x 10‘2 m = 2.98 cm Notice that if the liquid meniscus is convex, as for mercury, i.e., if cos 0 is negative then from Eq. (1 0.30) for example, it is clear that the liquid will be lower in the capillary ! 10.6.6 Detergents and Surface Tension We clean dirty clothes containing grease and oil stains sticking to cotton or other fabrics by adding detergents or soap to water, soaking clothes in it and shaking. Let us understand this process better. Washing with water does not remove grease stains. This is because water does not wet greasy dirt; i.e., there is very little area of contact between them. If water could wet grease, the ﬂow of water could carry some grease away. Something of this sort is achieved through detergents. The molecules of detergents are hairpin shaped, with one end attracted to water and the other to molecules of grease, oil or wax, thus tending to form water-oil interfaces. The result is shown in Fig. 10.22 as a sequence of ﬁgures. In our language, we would say that addition of detergents, whose molecules attract at one end and say, oil on the other, reduces drastically the surface tension S (water-oil). It may even become energetically favourable to form such interfaces, i.e., globs of dirt surrounded by detergents and then by water. This kind of process using surface active detergents or surfactants is important not only for cleaning, but also in recovering oil, mineral ores etc. Soap molecules Detergent is added, the 'inert' waxy ends of its molecules are attracted to boundary where water meets dirt.

The ascending limb continues as another highly coiled tubular region called distal convoluted tubule 030T). The DCTs of many nephrons open into a straight tube called collecting duct, many of which converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids in the calyces. The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DOT of the nephron are situated in the cortical region of the kidney whereas the loop of Henle dips into the medulla. In majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and extends only very little into the medulla. Such nephrons are called cortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons, the loop of Henle is very long and runs deep into the medulla. These nephrons are called juxta medullary nephrons. The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a ﬁne capillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular capillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’s loop forming a ‘U’ shaped vasa recta. Vasa recta is absent or highly reduced in cortical nephrons.

The ﬁrst step in urine formation is the ﬁltration of blood, which is carried out by the glomerulus and is called glomerular ﬁltration. On an average, 1 100- 1200 ml of blood is ﬁltered by the kidneys per minute which constitute roughly 1 /5“‘ of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes ﬁltration of blood through 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between these two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes are arranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called ﬁltration slits or slit pores. Blood is ﬁltered so ﬁnely through these membranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the proteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it is considered as a process of ultra ﬁltration.",1

The cycle continues till the earth’s surface has Greenhouse no long wave radiation to emit. Figure 16.6 Sunlight energy at the outermost atmosphere surprised to know that without greenhouse effect the average temperature at surface of Earth would have been a chilly —18°C rather than the present average of 15°C.

Clouds and gases reﬂect about one-fourth of the incoming solar radiation, and absorb some of it but almost half of incoming solar radiation falls on Earth’s surface heating it, while a small proportion is reﬂected back.

1663,215,"266 PHYSICS Suppose that we move the bar by a small distance d as shown. Since the area of the surface increases, the system now has more energy, this means that some work has been done against an internal force. Let this internal force be F, the work done by the applied force is F-d = Fd. From conservation of energy, this is stored as additional energy in the film. If the surface energy of the film is S per unit area, the extra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the liquid in between, so there are two surfaces and the extra energy is S (2dl) = Fd (10.21) Or, S=Fd/2dl= F/21 (10.22) This quantity S is the magnitude of surface tension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit area of the liquid interface and is also equal to the force per unit length exerted by the ﬂuid on the movable bar. So far we have talked about the surface of one liquid. More generally, we need to consider ﬂuid surface in contact with other ﬂuids or solid surfaces. The surface energy in that case depends on the materials on both sides of the surface. For example, if the molecules of the materials attract each other, surface energy is reduced while if they repel each other the surface energy is increased. Thus, more appropriately, the surface energy is the energy of the interface between two materials and depends on both of them. We make the following observations from above: (i) Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in the plane of the interface between the plane of the liquid and any other substance; it also is the extra energy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to molecules in the interior. (ii) At any point on the interface besides the boundary, we can draw a line and imagine 2019-20 equal and opposite surface tension forces S per unit length of the line acting perpendicular to the line, in the plane of the interface. The line is in equilibrium. To be more specific, imagine a line of atoms or molecules at the surface. The atoms to the left pull the line towards them; those to the right pull it towards them! This line of atoms is in equilibrium under tension. If the line really marks the end of the interface, as in Figure 10.16 (a) and (b) there is only the force S per unit length acting inwards. Table 10.3 gives the surface tension of various liquids. The value of surface tension depends on temperature. Like viscosity, the surface tension of a liquid usually falls with temperature.

1664,21,"l84 PHYSICS Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a deﬁnitive model in which the planets moved in circles around a fixed central sun. His theory was discredited by the church, but notable amongst its supporters was Galileo who had to face prosecution from the state for his beliefs. It was around the same time as Galileo, a nobleman called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) hailing from Denmark, spent his entire lifetime recording observations of the planets with the naked eye. His compiled data were analysed later by his assistant Johannes Kepler (157 l- 1640). He could extract from the data three elegant laws that now go by the name of Kepler’s laws. These laws were known to Newton and enabled him to make a great scientific leap in proposing his universal law of gravitation. 8.2 KEPLER'S LAWS The three laws of Kepler can be stated as follows: 1. Law of orbits : All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun situated at one of the foci Fig. 8.1(a) An ellipse traced out by a planet around the sun. The closest point is P and the farthest point is A, P is called the perihelion and A the aphelion. The semimajor axis is half the distance AP. Fig. 8.1(b) Drawing an ellipse. A string has its ends ﬁxed at F1 and F2. The tip of a pencil holds the string taut and is moved around. * Refer to information given in the Box on Page 182 2019-20 of the ellipse (Fig. 8.1a). This law was a deviation from the Copernican model which allowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of which the circle is a special case, is a closed curve which can be drawn very simply as follows. Select two points F1 and F2. Take a length of a string and fix its ends at F1 and F2 by pins. With the tip of a pencil stretch the string taut and then draw a curve by moving the pencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig. 8.1(b)) The closed curve you get is called an ellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse, the sum of the distances from F1 and F2 is a constant. F1, F2 are called the focii. Join the points F1 and F2 and extend the line to intersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown in Fig. 8.1(b). The midpoint of the line PA is the centre of the ellipse O and the length P0 = A0 is called the semi- major axis of the ellipse. For a circle, the two focii merge into one and the semi-major axis becomes the radius of the circle. 2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet to the sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time (Fig. 8.2). This law comes from the observations that planets appear to move slower when they are farther from the sun than when they are nearer. p (Planet) Fig. 8.2 The planet P moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit. The shaded area is the area AA swept out in a small interval of time At. 3. Law of periods : The square of the time period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced out by the planet. Table 8.1 gives the approximate time periods of revolution of eight* planets around the sun along with values of their semi-major axes.",0

They have a central gastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on hypostome. Digestion is extracellular and intracellular. Some of the cnidarians, e. g., corals have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibit two basic body forms called polyp and medusa (Figure 4.6). The former is a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia, etc. whereas, the latter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia or jelly ﬁsh. Those cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation of generation (Metagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually and medusae form the polyps sexually (e. g., Obelia).

Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscle ﬁbre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle ﬁbre has many parallelly arranged myoﬁbrils. Each myoﬁbril contains many serially arranged units called sarcomere which are the functional units.

1669,417,"Electromagnetic Induction where we have used dx/dt = —U which is the speed of the conductor P9. The induced emf B11) is called motional emf. Thus, we are able to produce induced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field, that is, by changing the magnetic ﬂux enclosed by the circuit. It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5) by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor PQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod moves with speed 0, the charge will also be moving with speed 0 in the magnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qu in magnitude, and its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in magnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod P9. The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is, W = qul Since emf is the work done per unit charge, 8:— q = Blv This equation gives emf induced across the rod P9 and is identical to Eq. (6.5). We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But it does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when the conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent magnetic field. On the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a conductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing — a fact which Faraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary conductor, the force on its charges is given by F=q(E+va)=qE (6.6) since v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric ﬁeld term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or induced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld generates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields produced by static electric charges have properties different from those produced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that charges in motion (current) can exert force / torque on a stationary magnet. Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing magnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the fundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and magnetism are related.

All GAS are branChes after decapitation acidic. They produce a wide range of physiological responses in the plants. Their ability to cause an increase in length of axis is used to increase the length of grapes stalks. Gibberellins, cause fruits like apple to elongate and improve its shape. They also delay senescence. Thus, the fruits can be left on the tree longer so as to extend the market period. GA3 is used to speed up the malting process in brewing industry. Sugarcane stores carbohydrate as sugar in their stems. Spraying sugarcane crop with gibberellins increases the length of the stem, thus increasing the yield by as much as 20 tonnes per acre. Spraying juvenile conifers with GAS hastens the maturity period, thus leading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting (intemode elongation just prior to ﬂowering) in beet, cabbages and many plants with rosette habit. 1 5.4.3.3 Cytokinins Cytokinins have speciﬁc effects on cytokinesis, and were discovered as kinetin (a modiﬁed form of adenine, a purine) from the autoclaved herring sperm DNA. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. Search for natural substances with cytokinin-like activities led to the isolation of zeatin from corn-kernels and coconut milk. Since the discovery of zeatin, several naturally occurring cytokinins, and some synthetic compounds with cell division promoting activity, have been identiﬁed. Natural cytokinins are synthesised in regions where rapid cell division occurs, for example, root apices, developing shoot buds, young fruits etc. It helps to produce new",1

The total mass of the system is M. (b) Next, take a rigid rod of negligible mass of length of length lwith a pair of small masses, rotating about an axis through the centre of mass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 7 .28). Each mass M / 2 is at a distance 1/2 from the axis. The moment of inertia of the masses is therefore given by (M/2) (1/2)2 + (M/2)(l/2)2 Thus, for the pair of masses, rotating about the axis through the centre of mass perpendicular to the rod I = Ml2 / 4 Table 7 . 1 simply gives the moment of inertia of various familiar regular shaped bodies about specific axes. (The derivations of these expressions are beyond the scope of this textbook and you will study them in higher classes.) As the mass of a body resists a change in its state of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia in linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of inertia about a given axis of rotation resists a change in its rotational motion, it can be regarded as a measure of rotational inertia of the body; it is a measure of the way in which different parts of the body are distributed at different distances from the axis. Unlike the mass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a fixed quantity but depends on distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the orientation and position of the axis of rotation 2019-20 with respect to the body as a whole. As a measure of the way in which the mass of a rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to the axis of rotation, we can define a new parameter, the radius of gyration. It is related to the moment of inertia and the total mass of the body. Notice from the Table 7.1 that in all cases, we can write I = Mk2, where k has the dimension of length. For a rod, about the perpendicular axis at its midpoint, k2 = L2/12, i.e. k = L/JE. Similarly, k = R/2 for the circular disc about its diameter. The length k is a geometric property of the body and axis of rotation. It is called the radius of gyration. The radius of gyration of a body about an axis may be defined as the distance from the axis of a mass point whose mass is equal to the mass of the whole body and whose moment of inertia is equal to the moment of inertia of the body about the axis. Thus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body depends on the mass of the body, its shape and size; distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the position and orientation of the axis of rotation. From the definition, Eq. (7 .34), we can infer that the dimensions of moments of inertia are ML2 and its SI units are kg m2. The property of this extremely important quantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of the body, has been put to a great practical use. The machines, such as steam engine and the automobile engine, etc., that produce rotational motion have a disc with a large moment of inertia, called a ﬂywheel. Because of its large moment of inertia, the ﬂywheel resists the sudden increase or decrease of the speed of the vehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed and prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring a smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle. 7.10 THEOREMS OF PERPENDICULAR AND PARALLEL AXES These are two useful theorems relating to moment of inertia.

Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a few leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile. Soak a few seeds in water (say of wheat, maize, peas, chickpeas, ground nut) overnight. Then split the seeds and observe the various parts of the embryo and the seed. 2.4.3 Seed In angiosperrns, the seed is the ﬁnal product of sexual reproduction. It is often described as a fertilised ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits. A seed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis. The cotyledons (Figure 2.15a) of the embryo are simple structures, generally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes). Mature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous. Non- albuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely consumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut). Albuminous seeds retain a part of endosperrn as it is not completely used up during embryo development (e. g., wheat, maize, barley, castor). Occasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of nucellus are also persistent. This residual, persistent nucellus is the perisperm. Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats (Figure 2.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat. This facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination. As the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become relatively dry (10- 15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic activity of the embryo slows down. The embryo may enter a state of inactivity called dormancy, or if favourable conditions are available (adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature), they germinate. As ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the transformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds simultaneously. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called pericarp. The fruits may be ﬂeshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or may be dry, as in groundnut, and mustard, etc. Many fruits have evolved mechanisms for dispersal of seeds. Recall the classiﬁcation of fruits and their dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class. Is there any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the number of seeds present in a fruit? In most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other ﬂoral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple, strawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus also contributes to fruit formation. Such fruits are called false fruits (Figure 2.15b). Most fruits however develop only from the ovary and are called true fruits. Although in most of the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few species 2019-2020",1
1677,321,"Nuclei In both [3' and [F decay, the mass number A remains unchanged. In ﬁ'decay, the atomic number Z of the nucleus goes up by 1, while in [3* decay Z goes down by 1. The basic nuclear process underlying [3' decay is the conversion of neutron to proton n—>p+e‘+ 17 (13.24) while for [3+ decay, it is the conversion of proton into neutron p—>n+e++v (13.25) Note that while a free neutron decays to proton, the decay of proton to neutron [Eq. (13.25)] is possible only inside the nucleus, since proton has smaller mass than neutron. 13.6.4 Gamma decay Like an atom, a nucleus also has discrete energy levels - the ground state and excited states. The scale of energy is, however, very different. Atomic energy level spacings are of the order of eV, while the difference in nuclear energy levels is of the order of MeV. When a nucleus in an excited state spontaneously decays to its ground state (or to a lower energy state), a photon is emitted with energy equal to the difference in the two energy levels of the nucleus. This is the so-called gamma decay. The energy (MeV) corresponds to radiation of extremely short E: 1.17 MeV wavelength, shorter than the hard X-ray region. Typically, a gamma ray is emitted when a 01 or B E7 = 1.33 MeV decay results in a daughter nucleus in an excited state. This then returns to the ground state by a single photon transition or successive transitions involving more than one photon. A familiar example is the successive emmission of gamma rays of energies 1 . 17 MeV and 1.33 MeV from the deexcitation of 3g N1 nuclei formed from [3' decay 60 of 27 Co. 13.7 NUCLEAR ENERGY The curve of binding energy per nucleon Eb”, given in Fig. 13.1, has a long ﬂat middle region between A = 30 and A = 170. In this region the binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant (8.0 MeV). For the lighter nuclei region, A < 30, and for the heavier nuclei region, A > 170, the binding energy per nucleon is less than 8.0 MeV, as we have noted earlier. Now, the greater the binding energy, the less is the total mass of a bound system, such as a nucleus. Consequently, if nuclei with less total binding energy transform to nuclei with greater binding energy, there will be a net energy release. This is what happens when a heavy nucleus decays into two or more intermediate mass fragments (ﬁssion) or when light nuclei fuse into a havier nucleus (fusion) Exothermic chemical reactions underlie conventional energy sources such as coal or petroleum.

Assuming human genome as 3 X 109 bp, in how many base sequences would there be differences? It is these differences in sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their phenotypic appearance. If one aims to find out genetic differences between two individuals or among individuals of a population, sequencing the DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive task. Imagine trying to compare two sets of 3 X 106 base pairs. DNA fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any two individuals. DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific regions in DNA sequence called as repetitive DNA, because in these sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These repetitive DNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during density gradient centrifugation. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and the other small peaks are referred to as satellite DNA. Depending on base composition (A : T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number of repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories, such as micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc. These sequences normally do not code for any proteins, but they form a large portion of human genome. These sequence show high degree of polymorphism and form the basis of DNA fingerprinting. Since DNA from every tissue (such as blood, hair-follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual show the same degree of polymorphism, they become very useful identiﬁcation tool in forensic applications. Further, as the polymorphisms are inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis of paternity testing, in case of disputes. As polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping of human genome as well as of DNA ﬁngerprinting, it is essential that we understand what DNA polymorphism means in simple terms. Polymorphism (variation at genetic level) arises due to mutations. (Recall different kind of mutations and their effects that you have already studied in Chapter 5, and in the preceding sections in this chapter.) New mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in the germ cells (cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing organisms). If a germ cell mutation does not seriously impair individual’s ability to have offspring who can transmit the mutation, it can spread to 2019-2020",1

Hence, it has improved.

1681,426,"Chapter Two ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL AND CAPACITANCE 2. 1 INTRODUCTION In Chapters 6 and 8 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy was introduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from a point to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force, that work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external force is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing an equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and potential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called conservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of conservative forces. Coulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative force. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence on distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants — the masses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s law. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational field, we can deﬁne electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an electrostatic field. Consider an electrostatic field E due to some charge configuration. First, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the origin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a point P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With reference 2019-20",0

1683,996,"266 BIOLOGY PEM Dietary deﬁciencies of proteins and total food calories are widespread in many underdeveloped countries of South and South-east Asia, South America, and West and Central Africa. Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) may affect large sections of the population during drought, famine and political turmoil. This happened in Bangladesh during the liberation war and in Ethiopia during the severe drought in mid-eighties. PEM affects infants and children to produce Marasmus and Kwashiorkar. Marasmus is produced by a simultaneous deﬁciency of proteins and calories. It is found in infants less than a year in age, if mother’s milk is replaced too early by other foods which are poor in both proteins and caloric value. This often happens if the mother has second pregnancy or childbirth when the older infant is still too young. In Marasmus, protein deﬁciency impairs growth and replacement of tissue proteins; extreme emaciation of the body and thinning of limbs results, the skin becomes dry, thin and wrinkled. Growth rate and body weight decline considerably. Even growth and development of brain and mental faculties are impaired. Kwashiorkar is produced by protein deﬁciency unaccompanied by calorie deﬁciency. It results ﬁom the replacement of mother’s milk by a high calorie- low protein diet in a child more than one year in age. Like marasmus, kwashiorkor shows wasting of muscles, thinning of limbs, failure of growth and brain development. But unlike marasmus, some fat is still left under the skin; moreover, extensive oedema and swelling of body parts are seen. SUMMARY The digestive system of humans consists of an alimentary canal and associated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of the mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectumﬁiﬁd‘ the anus. The accessory digestive glands include the salivary glands,the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. Inside the mouth the teéth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food and manipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Saliva contains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starch and converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into the pharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further carried down through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In stomach mainly protein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars, alcohol and medicines also takes place in the stomach. The chyme (food) enters into the duodenum portion of the small intestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bile and ﬁnally by the enzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into the jejunum and ileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digested and converted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are ﬁnally broken down into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol.",1

Various forms and functions of essential nutrient elements are given below. Nitrogen: This is the essential nutrient element required by plants in the greatest amount. It is absorbed mainly as NO; though some are also taken up as NO; or NH 4"". Nitrogen is required by all parts of a plant, particularly the meristematic tissues and the metabolically active cells. Nitrogen is one of the major constituents of proteins, nucleic acids, vitamins and hormones. Phosphorus: Phosphorus is absorbed by the plants from soil in the form of phosphate ions (either as HZPO:1 or HPOZ‘ ). Phosphorus is a constituent of cell membranes, certain proteins, all nucleic acids and nucleotides, and is required for all phosphorylation reactions. Potassium: It is absorbed as potassium ion (K+). In plants, this is required in more abundant quantities in the meristematic tissues, buds, leaves and root tips. Potassium helps to maintain an anion-cation balance in cells and is involved in protein synthesis, opening and closing of stomata, activation of enzymes and in the maintenance of the turgidity of cells. Calcium: Plant absorbs calcium from the soil in the form of calcium ions (Ca2+). Calcium is required by meristematic and differentiating tissues. During cell division it is used in the synthesis of cell wall, particularly as calcium pectate in the middle lamella. It is also needed during the formation of mitotic spindle. It accumulates in older leaves. It is involved in the normal functioning of the cell membranes. It activates certain enzymes and plays an important role in regulating metabolic activities. Magnesium: It is absorbed by plants in the form of divalent Mg”. It activates the enzymes of respiration, photosynthesis and are involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Magnesium is a constituent of the ring structure of chlorophyll and helps to maintain the ribosome structure. Sulphur: Plants obtain sulphur in the form of sulphate (SOZ‘) . Sulphur is present in two amino acids — cysteine and methionine and is the main constituent of several coenzymes, vitamins (thiamine, biotin, Coenzyme A) and ferredoxin. Iron: Plants obtain iron in the form of ferric ions (Fe3+). It is required in larger amounts in comparison to other micronutrients. It is an important constituent of proteins involved in the transfer of electrons like ferredoxin and cytochromes. It is reversibly oxidised from Fe2+ to Fe3+ during electron transfer. It activates catalase enzyme, and is essential for the formation of chlorophyll. 197",1

Thus every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement. In general, the errors in measurement can be broadly classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors. Systematic errors The systematic errors are those errors that tend to be in one direction, either positive or negative. Some of the sources of systematic errors are : (a) Instrumental errors that arise from the errors due to imperfect design or calibration of the measuring instrument, zero error in the instrument, etc. For example, the temperature graduations of a thermometer may be inadequately calibrated (it may read 104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP whereas it should read 100 °C); in a vernier callipers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may be worn off at one end. (b) Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure To determine the temperature of a human body, a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature. Other external conditions (such as changes in temperature, humidity, wind velocity, etc.) during the experiment may systematically affect the measurement. (c) Personal errors that arise due to an individual’s bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus or individual’s carelessness in taking observations without observing proper precautions, etc. For example, if you, by habit, always hold your head a bit too far to the right while reading the position of a needle on the scale, you will introduce an error due to parallax. Systematic errors can be minimised by improving experimental techniques, selecting better instruments and removing personal bias as far as possible. For a given set-up, these errors may be estimated to a certain extent and the necessary corrections may be applied to the readings. Random errors The random errors are those errors, which occur irregularly and hence are random with respect 2019-20",0

This is almost inevitable with ladies garments like a polyester saree. Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated due to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything that does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the study of forces, ﬁelds and potentials arising from static charges. 1 .2 ELECTRIC CHARGE Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece, around 600 BC.

Can we put an economic value on this service by nature? You can get some idea by ﬁnding out how much your neighborhood hospital spends on a cylinder of oxygen. Pollination (without which plants cannot give us fruits or seeds) is another service, ecosystems provide through pollinators layer — bees, bumblebees, birds and bats. What will be the costs of accomplishing pollination without help from natural pollinators? There are other intangible beneﬁts — that we derive from nature—the aesthetic pleasures of walking through thick woods, watching spring ﬂowers in full bloom or waking up to a bulbul’s song in the morning. Can we put a price tag on such things? The ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we owe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species with whom we share this planet. Philosophically or spiritually, we need to realise that every species has an intrinsic value, even if it may not be of current or any economic value to us. We have a moral duty to care for their well-being and pass on our biological legacy in good order to future generations. 15.2.2 How do we conserve Biodiversity? When we conserve and protect the whole ecosystem, its biodiversity at all levels is protected - we save the entire forest to save the tiger. This approach is called in situ (on site) conservation. However, when there are situations where an animal or plant is endangered or threatened (organisms facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future) and needs urgent measures to save it from extinction, ex situ (off site) conservation is the desirable approach. In situ conservation— Faced with the conﬂict between development and conservation, many nations ﬁnd it unrealistic and economically not feasible to conserve all their biological wealth. Invariably, the number of species waiting to be saved from extinction far exceeds the conservation resources available. On a global basis, this problem has been addressed by eminent conservationists. They identified for maximum protection certain ‘biodiversity hotspots’ regions with very high levels of species richness and high degree of endemism (that is, species confined to that region and not found anywhere else). Initially 25 biodiversity hotspots were identiﬁed but subsequently nine more have been added to the list, bringing the total number of biodiversity hotspots in the world to 34. These hotspots are also regions of accelerated habitat loss. Three of these hotspots — Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, Indo-Burma and Himalaya — cover our country’s exceptionally high biodiversity regions. Although all the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than 2 per cent of the earth’s land area, the number of species they collectively 2019-2020",1

For Q < O, V< O, i.e., work done (by the external force) per unit positive test charge in bringing it from inﬁnity to the point is negative. This is equivalent to saying that work done by the electrostatic force in bringing the unit positive charge form infinity to the point P is positive. [This is as it should be, since for Q < O, the force on a unit positive test charge is attractive, so that the electrostatic force and the displacement (from inﬁnity to P) are in the same direction.] Finally, we note that Eq.

All prokaryotic organisms were grouped together under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic organisms were placed in Kingdom Protista. Kingdom Protista has brought together Chlamydomonas, Chlorella (earlier placed in Algae within Plants and both having cell walls) with Paramoecium and Amoeba (which were earlier placed in the animal kingdom which lack cell wall). It has put together organisms which, in earlier classiﬁcations, were placed in different kingdoms. This happened because the criteria for classiﬁcation changed. This kind of changes will take place in future too depending on the improvement in our understanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Over time, an attempt has been made to evolve a classiﬁcation system which reﬂects not only the morphological, physiological and reproductive similarities, but is also phylogenetic, i.e., is based on evolutionary relationships. In this chapter we will study characteristics of Kingdoms Monera, Protista and Fungi of the Whittaker system of classiﬁcation. The Kingdoms Plantae and Animalia, commonly referred to as plant and animal kingdoms, respectively, will be dealt separately in chapters 3 and 4. 2. 1 KINGDOM MONERA Bacteria are the sole members of the Kingdom Monera. They are the most abundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundreds of bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitats such as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few other life forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms as parasites. Bacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: the spherical Coccus (pl.: cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl.: bacilli), the comma-shaped Vibrium (pl.: vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl.: spirilla) (Figure 2.1).

The positive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) between itself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked A in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative potential — (V_ ) (V_ 2 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it, marked as B in the ﬁgure. When there is no current, the electrolyte has the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference between P and N is V+ — (—V_) = V+ + V_ . This difference is called the electromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by 8. Thus 8: V++V_> o (3.55) Note that 8 is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The name emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was given at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly. To understand the significance of 8, consider a resistor R connected across the cell (Fig. 3.18). A current I ﬂows across R from C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained because current ﬂows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly, across the electrolyte the same current ﬂows through the electrolyte but from N to P, whereas through R, it ﬂows from P to N. The electrolyte through which a current ﬂows has a finite resistance r, called the internal resistance. Consider first the situation when R is infinite so that I = V/ R = 0, where V is the potential difference between P and N. Now, V= Potential difference between P and A + Potential difference between A and B + Potential difference between B and N = 8 (3.56) Thus, emf 8 is the potential difference between the positive and negative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is ﬂowing through the cell. If however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential difference between P and N is V=V++V_—Ir =8—Ir (3.57) Note the negative sign in the expression (I r) for the potential difference between A and B. This is because the current I ﬂows from B to A in the electrolyte. In practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit may be neglected when the current I is such that 8 >> I r. The actual values of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal resistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common 110 electrolytic cells. 2019-20",0

For typical values like A = 1 m2, d = 1 m, we get —12 2 —1 —2 2 c = 885x“) C_3N m “m = 8.85x10-9F (2.44) 10 In (You can check that if 1F= IC V1 = 10 (NC—1m)‘1 = 1 C2 N‘lm‘l.) This shows that 1F is too big a unit in practice, as remarked earlier. Another way of seeing the ‘bigness’ of IF is to calculate the area of the plates needed to have C = 1F for a separation of, say 1 cm: g : 1F >< 10‘2m 80 8.85 x 10'12C2N'1m'2 which is a plate about 30 km in length and breadth!

As before, we have two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. The charge on the plates is iQ, corresponding to the charge density i6 (with 6 = Q/A).

These are commonly found in the fruit walls of nuts; pulp of fruits like guava, pear and sapota; seed coats of legumes and leaves of tea. Sclerenchyma provides mechanical support to organs. 6.1 .2.2 Complex Tissues The complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells and these work together as a unit. Xylem and phloem constitute the complex tissues in plants (Figure 6.3). Xylem functions as a conducting tissue for water and minerals from roots to the stem and leaves. It also provides mechanical strength to the plant parts. It is composed of four different kinds of elements, namely, tracheids, vessels, xylem ﬁbres and xylem parenchyma. Gymnosperms lack vessels in their xylem. Tracheids are elongated or tube like cells with thick and ligniﬁed walls and tapering ends. These are dead and are without protoplasm. The inner layers of the cell walls have thickenings which vary in form. In ﬂowering plants, tracheids and vessels are the main water transporting elements. Vessel is a long cylindrical tube-like structure made up of many cells called vessel members, each with ligniﬁed walls and a large central cavity. The vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasm. Vessel members are interconnected through perforations in their common walls. The presence of vessels is a characteristic feature of angiosperms. Xylem ﬁbres have highly thickened walls and obliterated central lumens. These may either be septate or aseptate. Xylem parenchyma cells are living and thin-walled, and their cell walls are made up of cellulose. They store food materials in the form of starch or fat, and other substances like tannins. The radial conduction of water takes place by the ray parenchymatous cells. Primary xylem is of two types — protoxylem and metaxylem. The ﬁrst formed primary xylem elements are called protoxylem and the later formed primary xylem is called metaxylem. In stems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the metaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type of primary xylem is called endarch. In roots, the protoxylem lies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre. Such arrangement of primary xylem is called exarch. Phloem transports food materials, usually from leaves to other parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed of sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma Tracheid Vessels Sieve pore Sieve tube element Phloem parenchyma Companion cell (b) Figure 6.3 (a) Xylem (b) Phloem",1

Pressure potential is usually positive, though in plants negative potential or tension in the water column in the xylem plays a major role in water transport up a stem. Pressure potential is denoted as ‘I‘p. Water potential of a cell is affected by both solute and pressure potential. The relationship between them is as follows: A 1 1 .2.2 Osmosis The plant cell is surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall. The cell wall is freely permeable to water and substances in solution hence is not a barrier to movement. In plants the cells usually contain a large central vacuole, whose contents, the vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute potential of the cell. In plant cells, the cell membrane and the membrane of the vacuole, the tonoplast together are important determinants of movement of molecules in or out of the cell. Osmosis is the term used to refer speciﬁcally to the diffusion of water across a differentially- or selectively permeable membrane. Osmosis occurs spontaneously in response to a driving force. The net direction and rate of osmosis depends on both the pressure gradient and concentration gradient. Water will move from its region of higher chemical potential (or concentration) to its region of lower chemical potential until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium the two chambers should have nearly the same water potential. You may have made a potato osmometer in your earlier classes in school. If the potato tuber is placed in water, the water enters the cavity in the potato tuber containing a concentrated solution of sugar due to osmosis.

The ﬁsh gets protection from predators which stay away from the stinging tentacles. The anemone does not appear to derive any beneﬁt by hosting the clown ﬁsh. Mutualism: This interaction confers beneﬁts on both the interacting species. Lichens represent an intimate mutualistic relationship between a fungus and photosynthesising algae or cyanobacteria. Similarly, the mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the roots of higher plants. The fungi help the plant in the absorption of essential nutrients from the soil while the plant in turn provides the fungi with energy-yielding carbohydrates. The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships. Plants need the help of animals for pollinating their ﬂowers and dispersing their seeds. Animals obviously have to be paid ‘fees’ for the services that plants expect from them. Plants offer rewards or fees in the form of pollen and nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious fruits for seed dispersers. But the mutually beneﬁcial system should also be safeguarded against ‘cheaters’, for example, animals that try to steal nectar without aiding in pollination. Now you can see why plant-animal interactions often involve co-evolution of the mutualists, that is, the evolutions of the ﬂower and its pollinator species are tightly linked with one another. In many species of ﬁg trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp (Figure 13.7). It means that a given ﬁg species can be pollinated only by its ‘partner’ wasp species and no other species.

1704,1409,"GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE attempt synthesis over space. Maps are very effective tools of geographers in which the tabular data is converted into visual form to bring out the spatial pattern. BRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY Please study Figure 1. 1 for recapitulation. It has very clearly brought out that geography is an interdisciplinary subject of study. The study of every subject is done according to some approach. The major approaches to study geography have been (i) Systematic and (ii) Regional. The systematic geography approach is the same as that of general geography. This approach was introduced by Alexander Von Humboldt, a German geographer (1769-1859) while regional geography approach was developed by another German geographer and a contemporary of Humboldt, Karl Ritter (1779- 1859). In systematic approach (Figure 1.2), a phenomenon is studied world over as a whole, and then the identification of typologies or spatial patterns is done. For example, if one is interested in studying natural vegetation, the study will be done at the world level as a first step. The typologies such as equatorial rain forests or softwood conical forests or monsoon forests, etc. will be identified, discussed and delimited. In the regional approach, the world is divided into regions at different hierarchical levels and then all the geographical phenomena in a particular region are studied. These regions may be natural, political or designated region. The phenomena in a region are studied in a holistic manner searching for unity in diversity. Dualism is one of the main characteristics of geography which got introduced from the very beginning. This dualism depended on the aspect emphasised in the study. Earlier scholars laid emphasis on physical geography. But human beings are an integral part of the earth’s surface. They are part and parcel of nature. They also have contributed through their cultural development. Thus developed human geography with emphasis on human activities. BRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY (BASED ON SYSTEMATIC APPROACH) 1 . Physical Geography (i) Geomorphology is devoted to the study of landforms, their evolution and related processes. (ii) Climatology encompasses the study of structure of atmosphere and elements of weather and climates and climatic types and regions. (iii) Hydrology studies the realm of water over the surface of the earth including oceans, lakes, rivers and other water bodies and its effect on different life forms including human life and their activities. (iv) Soil Geography is devoted to study the processes of soil formation, soil types, their fertility status, distribution and use. 2. Human Geography (i) Social/ Cultural Geography encom- passes the study of society and its spatial dynamics as well as the cultural elements contributed by the society. (ii) Population and Settlement Geography (Rural and Urban). It studies population growth, distribution, density, sex ratio, migration and occupational structure etc. Settlement geography studies the characteristics of rural and urban settlements. (iii) Economic Geography studies economic activities of the people including agriculture, industry, tourism, trade, and transport, infrastructure and services, etc. (iv) Historical Geography studies the historical processes through which the space gets organised. Every region has undergone some historical experiences before attaining the present day status. The geographical features also experience temporal changes and these form the concerns of historical geography. 2019-2020",2
1705,1211,"HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE 8.2.5 Allergies When you have gone to a new place and suddenly you started sneezing, wheezing for no explained reason, and when you went away, your symptoms dissappeared. Did this happen to you? Some of us are sensitive to some particles in the environment. The above-mentioned reaction could be because of allergy to pollen, mites, etc., which are different in different places. The exaggerated response of the immune system to certain antigens present in the environment is called allergy. The substances to which such an immune response is produced are called allergens. The antibodies produced to these are of IgE type. Common examples of allergens are mites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. Symptoms of allergic reactions include sneezing, watery eyes, running nose and difﬁculty in breathing. Allergy is due to the release of chemicals like histamine and serotonin from the mast cells. For determining the cause of allergy, the patient is exposed to or injected with very small doses of possible allergens, and the reactions studied. The use of drugs like anti-histamine, adrenalin and steroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy. Somehow, modern-day life style has resulted in lowering of immunity and more sensitivity to allergens — more and more children in metro cities of India suffer from allergies and asthma due to sensitivity to the environment. This could be because of the protected environment provided early in life. 8.2.6 Auto Immunity Memory-based acquired immunity evolved in higher vertebrates based on the ability to differentiate foreign organisms (e. g., pathogens) from self- cells. While we still do not understand the basis of this, two corollaries of this ability have to be understood. One, higher vertebrates can distinguish foreign molecules as well as foreign organisms. Most of the experimental immunology deals with this aspect. Two, sometimes, due to genetic and other unknown reasons, the body attacks self-cells. This results in damage to the body and is called auto-immune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis which affects many people in our society is an auto-immune disease. 8.2.7 Immune System in the Body The human immune system consists of lymphoid organs, tissues, cells and soluble molecules like antibodies. As you have read, immune system is unique in the sense that it recognises foreign antigens, responds to these and remembers them. The immune system also plays an important role in allergic reactions, auto-immune diseases and organ transplantation. Lymphoid organs: These are the organs where origin and / or maturation and proliferation of lymphocytes occur. The primary lymphoid organs are bone marrow and thymus where immature lymphocytes differentiate 2019—2020 153",1
1706,1027,"REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS In many terrestrial organisms, belonging to fungi, higher animals such as reptiles, birds, mammals and in a majority of plants (bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms), syngamy occurs inside the body of the organism, hence the process is called internal fertilisation. In all these organisms, egg is formed inside the female body where they fuse with the male gamete. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation, the male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it. In these even though the number of sperms produced is very large, there is a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of eggs produced. In seed plants, however, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by pollen tubes. 1.2.3 Post-fertilisation Events Events in sexual reproduction after the formation of zygote are called post-fertilisation events. 1.2.3. 1 The Zygote Formation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing organisms. In organisms with external fertilisation, zygote is formed in the external medium (usually water), whereas in those exhibiting internal fertilisation, zygote is formed inside the body of the organism. Further development of the zygote depends on the type of life cycle the organism has and the environment it is exposed to. In organisms belonging to fungi and algae, zygote develops a thick wall that is resistant to dessication and damage. It undergoes a period of rest before germination. In organisms with haplontic life cycle (As you have read in Class XI), zygote divides by meiosis to form haploid spores that grow into haploid individuals. Consult your Class XI book and ﬁnd out what kind of development takes place in the zygote in organisms with diplontic and haplo—diplontic life cycles. Zygote is the vital link that ensures continuity of species between organisms of one generation and the next. Every sexually reproducing organism, including human beings begin life as a single cell—the zygote. 1 2.3.2 Embryogenesis Embryogenesis refers to the process of development of embryo from the zygote. During embryogenesis, zygote undergoes cell division (mitosis) and cell differentiation. While cell divisions increase the number of cells in the developing embryo; cell differentiation helps groups of cells to undergo certain modiﬁcations to form specialised tissues and organs to form an organism. You have studied about the process of cell division and differentiation in the previous class. 2019—2020",1

1709,557,"28 PI IYSICS the first uncertain digit are known as signiﬁcant digits or signiﬁcant ﬁgures. If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly, reporting the result of measurement that includes more digits than the significant digits is superﬂuous and also misleading since it would give a wrong idea about the precision of measurement. The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. A choice of change of different units does not change the number of signiﬁcant digits or ﬁgures in a measurement. This important remark makes most of the following observations clear: (1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or 23080 um. All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four. This shows that the location of decimal point is of no consequence in determining the number of significant figures. The example gives the following rules : 0 All the non-zero digits are signiﬁcant. 0 All the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all. 0 If the number is less than 1, the zero(s) on the right of decimal point but to the left of the ﬁrst non-zero digit are not signiﬁcant. [In 0% 2308, the underlined zeroes are not significant]. 0 The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant. [Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has three significant figures, the trailing zero(s) being not significant.] However, you can also see the next observation. 2019-20 0 The trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are signiﬁcant. [The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.] (2) There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If these were not, it would be superﬂuous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose we change units, then 4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a number with no decimal, we would conclude erroneously from observation (1) above that the number has two significant figures, while in fact, it has four significant figures and a mere change of units cannot change the number of significant figures. (3) To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientiﬁc notation (in the power of 10). In this notation, every number is expressed as a X 10b, where a is a number between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1 (for a g 5) and to 10 (for 5<ag 10). Then the number can be expressed approximately as 10b in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of magnitude of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of 10’. For example, the diameter of the earth (1.28X107m) is of the order of 107m with the order of magnitude 7.

An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes. 3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS An electric charge will experience a force if an electric ﬁeld is applied. If it is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the ionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water, for example, contains approximately 1 O22 molecules. These molecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached to individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound, i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric ﬁeld is applied. In other materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move within the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors, develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied. If we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly bound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like electrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move. In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background of fixed positive ions. Consider ﬁrst the case when no electric field is present. The electrons will be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the fixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed as before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the collision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential direction for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the 2019-20",0

1716,47,"UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 31 For example, 12.9 g — 7.06 g, both speciﬁed to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted). (3) The relative error of a value of number speciﬁed to signiﬁcant ﬁgures depends not only on 11 but also on the number itself. For example, the accuracy in measurement of mass 1.02 g is i 0.0 1 g whereas another measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to i 0.01 g. The relative error in 1.02 g is = (i 0.01/1.02) x 100 % = i 1% Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is = (i 0.01/9.89) x 100 % = i 0.1 % Finally, remember that intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more signiﬁcant ﬁgure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement. These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of signiﬁcant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written 1 / 9.58 = 0.1044 and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58. This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers. 2.8 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions. All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity. Note that using the square brackets [ ] round a quantity means that we are dealing with ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity. In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the dimensions of volume are [L] X [L] X [L] = [L]3 = [L3]. As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°], zero dimension in time [T°] and three dimensions in length. Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as Force = mass X acceleration = mass X (length)/(time)2 The dimensions of force are [M] [L] / [T]2 = [M L T2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and —2 dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero. Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters. Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity, average velocity, ﬁnal velocity, and speed are all equivalent in this context. Since all these quantities can be expressed as length/time, their dimensions are [L]/ [T] or [L ""1“]. 2.9 DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE AND DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity is called the dimensional formula of the given physical quantity. For example, the dimensional formula of the volume is [M° L3 T°], and that of speed or velocity is [M° LT1]. Similarly, [M° L’I‘2] is the dimensional formula of acceleration and [M L‘3 T°] that of mass density. An equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula is called the dimensional equation of the physical 2019-20",0
1717,783,"PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION 5.4 POLYGENIC INHERITANCE Mendel’s studies mainly described those traits that have distinct alternate forms such as ﬂower colour which are either purple or white. But if you look around you will ﬁnd that there are many traits which are not so distinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example, in humans we don’t just have tall or short people as two distinct alternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally controlled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits. Besides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes into account the inﬂuence of environment. Human skin colour is another classic example for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reﬂects the contribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To understand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin colour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for dark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour. The genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest skin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the lightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles and three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour. In this manner the number of each type of alleles in the genotype would determine the darkness or lightness of the skin in an individual. 5.5 PLEIOTROPY We have so far seen the effect of a gene on a single phenotype or trait. There are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple phenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The underlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene on metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes. An example of this is the disease phenylketonuria, which occurs in humans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests itself through phenotypic expression characterised by mental retardation and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation. 5.6 SEX DETERMINATION The mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the geneticists. The initial clue about the genetic / chromosomal mechanism of sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried out in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of insects led to the development of the concept of genetic / chromosomal basis of sex-determination. Henking (189 1) could trace a specific nuclear structure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was also observed by him that 50 per cent of the sperm received this structure after spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive it. Henking gave a name to this structure as the X body but he could not explain its signiﬁcance. Further investigations by other scientists led to the conclusion that the ‘X body’ of Henking was in fact a chromosome 2019-2020",1
1718,372,"Chapter Four MOVING CHARGES AND MAGNETISIVI 4. 1 INTRODUCTION Both Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000 years. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was realised that they were intimately related*. During a lecture demonstration in the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deﬂection in a nearby magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the earth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deﬂection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted concluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic ﬁeld in the surrounding space. Following this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws obeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by * See the box in Chapter 1, Page 3. 2019-20",0
1719,14,"i Physics é” (21} /¢ FIGURE 6.6 Illustration of 210 (b) Lenz’s law. 6.5 LENz’s LAW AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY In 1 834, German physicist Heinrich Friedrich Lenz (1 804- 1 865) deduced a rule, known as Lenz’s law which gives the polarity of the induced emf in a clear and concise fashion. The statement of the law is: The polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic ﬂux that produced it. The negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can understand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In Fig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed towards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards the coil, the magnetic ﬂux through the coil increases. Hence current is induced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in ﬂux. This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet. Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity towards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North- pole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic ﬂux through the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic ﬂux, the induced current in the coil ﬂows in clockwise direction and its South- pole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the corresponding decrease in ﬂux. What will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop in the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open ends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found using Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier way to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the direction shown by N and $ indicate the directions of the induced currents. A little reﬂection on this matter should convince us on the correctness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in the direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case, the South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching North-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted towards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on the magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy will continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can happen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a suitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy and hence can not happen. Now consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation, the bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced current. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet. Where does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is dissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current. 2019-20",0

What happens in a system, which is a collection of such objects? A material medium provides such an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents to each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of the other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water, the water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not remain confined to one place, but propagates outward along a circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you see circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the water surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is moving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put some cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that the cork pieces move up and down but do not move away from the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water mass does not ﬂow outward with the circles, but rather a moving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak, the sound moves outward from us, without any ﬂow of air from one part of the medium to another. The disturbances produced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or a microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move without the actual physical transfer or ﬂow of matter as a whole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such waves. Waves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has information that propagate from one point to another. All our communications essentially depend on transmission of sig- nals through waves. Speech means production of sound waves in air and hearing amounts to their detection. Often, communication involves different kinds of waves. For exam- ple, sound waves may be ﬁrst converted into an electric cur- rent signal which in turn may generate an electromagnetic wave that may be transmitted by an optical cable or via a 2019-20",0

Thus, FIGURE 9.20 Power of a lens. P= — (9.25) The SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): ID = lm‘l. The power of a lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an optician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is a convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of — 4.0 D means a concave lens of focal length — 25 cm. Example 9.8 (i) If f = 0.5 m for a glass lens, What is the power of the lens? (ii) The radii of curvature of the faces of a double convex lens are 10 cm and 15 cm. Its focal length is 12 cm. What is the refractive index of glass? (iii) A convex lens has 20 cm focal length in air. What is focal length in water? (Refractive index of air-water = 1.33, refractive index for air-glass = 1.5.) Solution (i) Power = +2 dioptre.

1723,1209,"RESPIRATION IN PLANTS Now let us compare fermentation and aerobic respiration: ' Fermentation accounts for only a partial breakdown of glucose whereas in aerobic respiration it is completely degraded to CO2 and H20. ° In fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose degraded to pyruvic acid whereas many more molecules of ATP are generated under aerobic conditions. ' NADH is oxidised to NAD+ rather slowly in fermentation, however the reaction is very vigorous in case of aerobic respiration. 14.6 AMPHIBOLIC PATHWAY Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. All carbohydrates are usually ﬁrst converted into glucose before they are used for respiration. Other substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but then they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the ﬁrst step. See Figure 14.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory pathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids ﬁrst. If fatty acids were to be respired they would ﬁrst be degraded to acetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway after being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by proteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending on their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’ cycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA. Since respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratory process has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the respiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway. But is this understanding correct? We have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory pathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and used to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very compounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the synthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down to acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a substrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl CoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the respiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and synthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of protein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down processes within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is anabolism. Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism and catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway as an amphibolic pathway rather than as a catabolic one. 235",1

Globulins primarly are involved in defense mechanisms of the body and the albumins help in osmotic balance. Plasma also contains small amounts of minerals like Na“, Ca“, Mg“, HCOg, 01‘, etc. Glucose, amino acids, lipids, etc., are also present in the plasma as they are always in transit in the body. Factors for coagulation or clotting of blood are also present in the plasma in an inactive form. Plasma without the clotting factors is called serum. 18. 1 .2 Formed Elements Erythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets are collectively called formed elements Wigure 18. 1) and they constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood. Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all the cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to 5.5 millions of RBCs mm‘3 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals and are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these cells. A healthy individual has 12- 16 gms of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood. These molecules play a signiﬁcant role in transport of respiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which they are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs). Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are relatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm‘3 of blood. Leucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs — granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes are the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65 per cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5- 1 per cent) among them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic cells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inﬂammatory reactions.

Thus for the same quantity of matter, nuclear sources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source. Fission of 1 kg of uranium, for example, generates 1014 J of energy; compare it with burning of 1 kg of coal that gives 107 J. 13.7. 1 Fission New possibilities emerge when we go beyond natural radioactive decays and study nuclear reactions by bombarding nuclei with other nuclear particles such as proton, neutron, oc-particle, etc. A most important neutron-induced nuclear reaction is ﬁssion. An example of fission is when a uranium isotope 2325U bombarded with a neutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments 1 235 236 144 89 1 on+92U—> 92U—> 56Ba+36Kr+30n (13.26) The same reaction can produce other pairs of intermediate mass fragments gn+2§§U —> 2§§U —> 1§§Sb+ Z?Nb+4gn (13.27) Or, as another example, gn+ 2g§U —> 132x“ §§Sr + 2 am (13.28) The fragment products are radioactive nuclei; they emit [3 particles in succession to achieve stable end products. The energy released (the Qvalue ) in the fission reaction of nuclei like uranium is of the order of 200 MeV per fissioning nucleus. This is estimated as follows: Let us take a nucleus with A = 240 breaking into two fragments each ofA = 120. Then Elm for A = 240 nucleus is about 7.6 MeV, Elm for the two A = 120 fragment nuclei is about 8.5 MeV. Gain in binding energy for nucleon is about 0.9 MeV. Hence the total gain in binding energy is 24OXO.9 or 2 16 MeV. The disintegration energy in fission events first appears as the kinetic energy of the fragments and neutrons. Eventually it is transferred to the surrounding matter appearing as heat. The source of energy in nuclear reactors, which produce electricity, is nuclear fission. The enormous energy released in an atom bomb comes from uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion. We discuss some details in the next section how a nuclear reactor functions. 13.7.2 Nuclear reactor Notice one fact of great importance in the fission reactions given in Eqs. (13.26) to (13.28).

1727,1428,"132 Species Diversity This refers to the variety of species. It relates to the number of species in a deﬁned area. The diversity of species can be measured through its richness, abundance and types. Some areas are more rich in species than others. Areas rich in species diversity are called hotspots of diversity (Figure l 6.5). Ecosystem Diversity You have studied about the ecosystem in the earlier chapter. The broad differences between ecosystem types and the diversity of habitats and ecological processes occurring within each ecosystem type constitute the ecosystem diversity. The ‘boundaries’ of communities (associations of species) and ecosystems are not very rigidly defined. Thus, the demarcation of ecosystem boundaries is difficult and complex. Figure 16. 1 : Grasslands and sholas in Indira Gandhi National Park, Annamalai, Western Ghats — an example of ecosystem diversity Importance of Biodiversity Biodiversity has contributed in many ways to the development of human culture and, in turn, human communities have played a major role in shaping the diversity of nature at the genetic, species and ecological levels. Biodiversity plays the following roles: ecological, economic and scientific. Ecological Role of Biodiversity Species of many kinds perform some function or the other in an ecosystem. Nothing in an FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY ecosystem evolves and sustains without any reason. That means, every organism, besides extracting its needs, also contributes something of useful to other organisms. Can you think of the way we, humans contribute to the sustenance of ecosystems. Species capture and store energy, produce and decompose organic materials, help to cycle water and nutrients throughout the ecosystem, fix atmospheric gases and help regulate the climate. These functions are important for ecosystem function and human survival. The more diverse an ecosystem, better are the chances for the species to survive through adversities and attacks, and consequently, is more productive. Hence, the loss of species would decrease the ability of the system to maintain itself. Just like a species with a high genetic diversity, an ecosystem with high biodiversity may have a greater chance of adapting to environmental change. In other words, the more the variety of species in an ecosystem, the more stable the ecosystem is likely to be. Economic Role of Biodiversity For all humans, biodiversity is an important resource in their day-to-day life. One important part of biodiversity is ‘crop diversity’, which is also called agro-biodiversity. Biodiversity is seen as a reservoir of resources to be drawn upon for the manufacture of food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. This concept of biological resources is responsible for the deterioration of biodiversity. At the same time, it is also the origin of new conﬂicts dealing with rules of division and appropriation of natural resources. Some of the important economic commodities that biodiversity supplies to humankind are: food crops, livestock, forests, fish, medicinal resources, etc. Scientiﬁc Role of Biodiversity Biodiversity is important because each species can give us some clue as to how life evolved and will continue to evolve. Biodiversity also helps in understanding how life functions and the role of each species in sustaining 2019-2020",2

The amount of discount/ loss on issue of debentures should normally not be written-off in the year of issue itself since the benefit of the debentures would accrue to the company till their redemption. The discount/ loss on it is, therefore, treated as capital loss. The discount may be charged to Securities Premium A/c or may be written—off over 3 to 5 years through statement of profit and loss as per guidelines issued by ICAI. In case, however, there are no capital profits or if the capital proﬁts are not adequate, the amount of such discount/ loss can be written—off against the revenue profits every year by passing the following journal entry. Statement of Proﬁt and Loss Dr. To Discount/ Loss on Issue of Debentures A/c (Discount/ loss on issue of debentures written-oft] There are two methods, which can be adopted to write off discount/ loss on issue of debentures against the revenue profits. These are as follows. 1. Fixed Instalment Method: When the debentures are redeemed at the end of a speciﬁed period, the total amount of discount should be written off in equal instalments of ﬁxed amount over that period. For example, if the debentures are to be redeemed after 10 years then out of the total amount of discount of Rs. 1 ,00,000, Rs. 10,000 will be written-off every year. 2. Fluctuating Instalment Method: When debentures are repaid by annual drawings or in instalments, the discount should be written-off in the ratio of debentures outstanding as at the end of each accounting year. The amount of discount, under this method, goes on reducing year. The amount of discount, under this method, goes on reducing every year and so this method may also be known as Reducing Instalment Method. For example, a company issues Rs. 1 5,00,000, 9% debentures at a discount of 10% redeemable by annual drawings of Rs. 3,00,000 at the end of each year.

A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases is not necessarily periodic. It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral multiple of the other's frequency. However. a periodic motion can always be expressed as a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes. The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant. Contrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation [Kepler's third law). The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement. For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic. its displacement xmust be expressible in either of the following forms : x=Acos wt + Bsin wt x=Acos[wt+a).x= Bsin[wt+ﬁ) The three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any other two forms). Thus. damped simple harmonic motion [Eq. [14.31)] is not strictly simple harmonic. It is approximately so only for time intervals much less than 2m/ b where b is the damping constant. In forced oscillations. the steady state motion of the particle (after the forced oscillations die out) is simple harmonic motion whose frequency is the frequency of the driving frequency cod. not the natural frequency a) of the particle. In the ideal case of zero damping, the amplitude of simple harmonic motion at resonance is infinite. Since all real systems have some damping. however small. this situation is never observed. Under forced oscillation. the phase of harmonic motion of the particle differs from the phase of the driving force. Exercises Which of the following examples represent periodic motion?

1730,1133,"208 BIOLOGY It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch. Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 — 1909). Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of 02 evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll aand b (discussed in section 13.4). By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO2 and water. The empirical equation representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as: Light co2 + H20 [CHZO]+ 02 where [CHZO] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: Light 2H2A+CO2 2A+CH2O+ H20 In green plants H20 is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to 02. Some organisms do not release 02 during photosynthesis. When H28, instead is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not 02. Hence, he inferred that the O2 evolved by the green plant comes from H20, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques. The correct equation, that would represent the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore: Light esco2 + 12H2O C6H1206 +6H20+ 602 where C6 H12 06 represents glucose. The 02 released is from water; this was proved using radio isotope techniques. Note that this is not a single 2019-2020",1
1731,413,"THERMODYNAMICS — POINTS TO PONDER 1. Temperature of a body is related to its average internal energi, not to the kinetic energy of motion of its centre of mass. A bullet ﬁred from a gun is not at a higher temperature because of its high speed. Equilibrium in thermodynamics refers to the situation when macroscopic variables describing the thermodynamic state of a system do not depend on time. Equilibrium of a system in mechanics means the net external force and torque on the system are zero. In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic constituents of a system are not in equilibrium (in the sense of mechanics). Heat capacity, in general, depends on the process the system goes through when heat is supplied. In isothermal quasi-static processes, heat is absorbed or given out by the system even though at every stage the gas has the same temperature as that of the surrounding reservoir. This is possible because of the inﬁnitesimal difference in temperature between the system and the reservoir. EXERCISES",0
1732,775,"ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS are available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean. Among the red, green and brown algae that inhabit the sea, which is likely to be found in the deepest waters? Why? Soil: The nature and properties of soil in different places vary; it is dependent on the climate, the weathering process, whether soil is transported or sedimentary and how soil development occurred. Various characteristics of the soil such as soil composition, grain size and aggregation determine the percolation and water holding capacity of the soils. These characteristics along with parameters such as pH, mineral composition and topography determine to a large extent the vegetation in any area. This in turn dictates the type of animals that can be supported. Similarly, in the aquatic environment, the sediment-characteristics often determine the type of benthic animals that can thrive there. 13. 1.2 Responses to Abiotic Factors Having realised that the abiotic conditions of many habitats may vary drastically in time, we now ask—how do the organisms living in such habitats cope or manage with stressﬁil conditions? But before attempting to answer this question, we should perhaps ask ﬁrst why a highly variable external environment should bother organisms after all. One would expect that during the course of millions of years of their existence, many species would have evolved a relatively constant internal (within the body) environment that permits all biochemical reactions and physiological functions to proceed with maximal efﬁciency and thus, enhance the overall ‘ﬁtness’ of the species. This constancy, for example, could be in terms of optimal temperature and osmotic concentration of body ﬂuids. Ideally then, the organism should try to maintain the constancy of its internal environment (a process called homeostasis) despite varying external environmental conditions that tend to upset its homeostasis. Let us take an analogy to clarify this important concept. Suppose a person is able to perform his / her best when the temperature is 25°C and wishes to maintain it so, even when it is Partial regulators Internal level —> External level—> Figure 13.3 Diagrammatic representation of scorchingly hot or freezingly cold outside. It organismic response could be achieved at home, in the car while travelling, and at workplace by using an air conditioner in summer and 223 heater in winter. Then his / her performance would be always maximal regardless of the weather around him / her. Here the person’s homeostasis is accomplished, not through physiological, but artiﬁcial means. How do other living organisms cope with the situation? Let us look at various possibilities (Figure 1 3.3). 2019-2020",1

The lower edge is riveted t0 the ﬂoor. How much will the upper edge be displaced? Answer The lead slab is fixed and the force is applied parallel to the narrow face as shown in Fig. 9.7. The area of the face parallel to which this force is applied is A =50cm>< 10cm =0.5m><0.1m =O.O5m2 2019-20 Therefore, the stress applied is = (9.4 x 104 N/0.05 m2) = 1.80 x 106 N.m‘2 Fig. 9.7 We know that shearing strain = (Ax/L)= Stress / G. Therefore the displacement Ax = (Stress x L)/ G = (1.8 x 106 N m‘2 x O.5m)/(5.6 x 109 N m‘z) =1.6><104m=0.16mm 4 9.6.4 Bulk Modulus In Section (9.3), we have seen that when a body is submerged in a ﬂuid, it undergoes a hydraulic stress (equal in magnitude to the hydraulic pressure). This leads to the decrease in the volume of the body thus producing a strain called volume strain [Eq. (9.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic stress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is called bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B. B=-P/(AV/V) (9.13) The negative sign indicates the fact that with an increase in pressure, a decrease in volume occurs. That is, if p is positive, AV is negative. Thus for a system in equilibrium, the value of bulk modulus B is always positive. SI unit of bulk modulus is the same as that of pressure i.e., N m‘2 or Pa. The bulk moduli of a few common materials are given in Table 9.3. The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called compressibility and is denoted by k. It is defined as the fractional change in volume per unit increase in pressure. k=(1/B)=-(1/AP)><(AV/V) (9.14) It can be seen from the data given in Table 9.3 that the bulk moduli for solids are much larger than for liquids, which are again much larger than the bulk modulus for gases (air).",0

Thus, the number of field lines crossing AS is proportional to E AS cos6. When 0 = 90°, field lines will be parallel to AS and will not cross it —’ E we place a small planar element of area AS I normal to E at a point, the number of field lines _ _. E crossing it is proportional* to E AS. Now As — w suppose we tilt the area element by angle 6. E at all (Fig. 1.18). The orientation of area element and not — merely its magnitude is important in many contexts. For example, in a stream, the amount _ of water ﬂowing through a ring will naturally depend on how you hold the ring. If you hold it normal to the ﬂow, maximum water will ﬂow through it than if you hold it with some other orientation. This shows that an area element should be treated as a vector. It has a magnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar area? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the plane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal. How to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements. Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated with it, as explained before. Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along its normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element? This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given as = A S ,3 context. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple. The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken to be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used in Fig. 1.19. Thus, the area element vector AS at a point on a closed FIGURE 1.18 Dependence of ﬂux on the inclination 6 between E and n . surface equals AS 11 where AS is the magnitude of the area element and fl is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point. We now come to the definition of electric ﬂux. Electric ﬂux A¢ through an area element AS is defined by A¢=E~AS =EAS cos0 (1.11) which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting the area element. The angle 0 here is the angle between E and AS. For a closed surface, with the convention stated already, 9 is the angle between FIGURE 1. 19 E and the outward normal to the area element. Notice we could look at the expression E AS cos0 in two ways: E (AS cos6) i.e., E times the Convention for defining normal — v. and AS. * It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to EAS. The number of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to draw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing a given area at different points. 26 2019-20",0

At the same time, we try to discover physical quantities, which do not change in a physical process. The laws of momentum and energy conservation are typical examples. In this section we shall apply these laws to a commonly encountered phenomena, namely collisions. Several games such as billiards, marbles or carrom involve collisions.We shall study the collision of two masses in an idealised form. Consider two masses m1 and m2. The particle m1 is moving with speed 1)”, the subscript ‘i’ implying initial. We can cosider m2 to be at rest. No loss of generality is involved in making such a selection. In this situation the mass m1 collides with the stationary mass m2 and this is depicted in Fig. 6.10. y /,0/L1f / m1 // ”1 .l_. g— m1 m2\ 92 x \ \ \ \ m2 U2f Fig. 6. 1 0 Collisionofmass m1, withastationmy mass m2. The masses m1 and m2 ﬂy-off in different directions. We shall see that there are relationships, which connect the masses, the velocities and the angles. 6.12.1 Elastic and Inelastic Collisions In all collisions the total linear momentum is conserved; the initial momentum of the system is equal to the final momentum of the system. One can argue this as follows. When two objects collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over the collision time At cause a change in their respective momenta : Apl = F12 At Ap2 = F21 At where F12 is the force exerted on the first particle by the second particle. F21 is likewise the force exerted on the second particle by the ﬁrst particle. Now from Newton’s third law, F12 = — F21. This implies Ap1 + Ap2 = 0 The above conclusion is true even though the forces vary in a complex fashion during the collision time At. Since the third law is true at every instant, the total impulse on the ﬁrst object is equal and opposite to that on the second. On the other hand, the total kinetic energy of the system is not necessarily conserved. The impact and deformation during collision may generate heat and sound. Part of the initial ldnetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy. A useful way to visualise the deformation during collision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring’. If the ‘spring’ connecting the two masses regains its original shape without loss in energy, then the initial kinetic energy is equal to the ﬁnal kinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the collision time At is not constant. Such a collision is called an elastic collision. On the other hand the deformation may not be relieved and the two bodies could move together after the collision. A collision in which the two particles move together after the collision is called a completely inelastic collision. The intermediate case where the deformation is partly relieved and some of the initial kinetic energy is lost is more common and is appropriately called an inelastic collision. 6. 12.2 Collisions in One Dimension Consider first a completely inelastic collision in one dimension.

If E. coli was allowed to grow for 80 minutes then what would be the proportions of light and hybrid densities DNA molecule? Very similar experiments involving use of radioactive thymidine to detect distribution of newly synthesised DNA in the chromosomes was performed on Viciafaba (faba beans) by Taylor and colleagues in 1958. The experiments proved that the DNA in chromosomes also replicate semiconservatively. 6.4.2 The Machinery and the Enzymes In living cells, such as E. coli, the process of replication requires a set of catalysts (enzymes). The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the polymerisation of deoxynucleotides. These enzymes are highly efficient enzymes as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of nucleotides in a very short time. E. coli that has only 4.6 X 10‘5 bp (compare it with human whose diploid content is 6.6 X 109 bp), completes the process of replication within 18 minutes; that means the average rate of polymerisation has to be approximately 2000 bp per second. Not only do these polymerases have to be fast, but they also have to catalyse the reaction with high degree of accuracy. Any mistake during replication would result into mutations. Furthermore, energetically replication is a very expensive process. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes. In addition to acting as substrates, they provide energy for polymerisation reaction (the two terminal phosphates in a deoxynucleoside triphosphates are high-energy phosphates, same as in case of ATP). In addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, many additional enzymes are required to complete the process of replication with high degree of accuracy. For long DNA molecules, since the two strands of DNA cannot be separated in its entire length (due to very high energy requirement), the replication occur within a small opening of the DNA helix, referred to as replication fork. The DNA-dependent DNA polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, that is 5,93,. This creates some additional complications at the replicating fork. Consequently, on one strand (the template with polarity 395'), the replication is continuous, while on the other (the template with polarity 593'), it is discontinuous. The discontinuously synthesised fragments are later joined by the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 6.8). The DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate the process of replication. Also the replication does not initiate randomly at any place in DNA. There is a definite region in E. coli DNA where the replication originates. Such regions are termed as origin of replication. It is 2019—2020",1

The wider part of the meter has a cross- sectional area equal to that of the artery. A = 8 mm2. The narrower part has an area a = 4 mmz. The pressure drop in the artery is 24 Pa. What is the speed of the blood in the artery? Answer We take the density of blood from Table 10.1 to be 1.06 x 103 kg m‘3. The ratio of the A areas is (a) = 2. Using Eq. (10.17) we obtain v = & =0 123ms'1 1 1060kg m-3x(22— 1) ' 10.4.3 Blood Flow and Heart Attack Bernoulli’s principle helps in explaining blood ﬂow in artery. The artery may get constricted due to the accumulation of plaque on its inner walls. In order to drive the blood through this constriction a greater demand is placed on the activity of the heart. The speed of the ﬂow of the blood in this region is raised which lowers the pressure inside and the artery may collapse due to the external pressure. The heart exerts further pressure to open this artery and forces the blood through. As the blood rushes through the opening, the internal pressure once again drops clue to same reasons leading to a repeat collapse. This may result in heart attack. l) [a] 10.4.4 Dynamic Lift Dynamic lift is the force that acts on a body, such as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning ball, by virtue of its motion through a ﬂuid. In many games such as cricket, tennis, baseball, or golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates from its parabolic trajectory as it moves through air. This deviation can be partly explained on the basis of Bernoulli’s principle. (i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 10.13(a) shows the streamlines around a non-spinning ball moving relative to a ﬂuid. From the symmetry of streamlines it is clear that the velocity of ﬂuid (air) above and below the ball at corresponding points is the same resulting in zero pressure difference. The air therefore, exerts no upward or downward force on the ball. (ii) Ball moving with spin: A ball which is spinning drags air along with it. If the surface is rough more air will be dragged. Fig 10.13(b) shows the streamlines of air for a ball which is moving and spinning at the same time. The ball is moving forward and relative to it the air is moving backwards. Therefore, the velocity of air above the ball relative to the ball is larger and below it is smaller (see Section 10.3). The stream lines, thus, get crowded above and rarified below. This difference in the velocities of air results in the pressure difference between the lower and upper faces and there is a net upward force on the ball. This dynamic lift clue to spining is called Magnus effect. Fig 1 O. 1 3 (a) Fluid streaming past a static sphere. (b) Streamlines for a ﬂuid around a sphere spinning clockwise.

The period from birth to the natural death of an organism represents its life span. Life spans of a few organisms are given in Figure 1.1. Several other organisms are drawn for which you should ﬁnd out their life spans and write in the spaces provided. Examine the life spans of organisms represented in the Figure 1.1. Isn’t it both interesting and intriguing to note that it may be as short as a few days or as long as a few thousand years? Between these two extremes are the life spans of most other living organisms. You may note that life spans of organisms are not necessarily correlated with their sizes; the sizes of crows and parrots are not very different yet their life spans show a wide difference. Similarly, a mango tree has a much shorter life span as compared to a peepal tree. Whatever be the life span, death of every individual organism is a certainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled organisms. Why do we say there is no natural death in single— celled organisms?

The surface has been considered to possess negligible friction. 4 We conclude this section by making a few remarks on conservative forces. (i) Information on time is absent from the above discussions. In the example considered above, we can calculate the compression, but not the time over which the compression occurs. A solution of Newton’s Second Law for this system is required for temporal information. (ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for example, is a non-conservative force. The principle of conservation of energy will have to be modified in this case. This is illustrated in Example 6.9. (iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary. It is set according to convenience. For the spring force we took V(x) = O, at x = O, i.e. the unstretched spring had zero potential energy. For the constant gravitational force mg, we took V= O on the earth’s surface. In a later chapter we shall see that for the force due to the universal law of gravitation, the zero is best defined at an infinite distance from the gravitational source. However, once the zero of the potential energy is fixed in a given discussion, it must be consistently adhered to throughout the discussion. You cannot change horses in midstream ! > Example 6.9 Consider Example 6.8 taking the coefﬁcient of friction. u. to be 0.5 and calculate the maximum compression of the spring. Answer In presence of friction, both the spring force and the frictional force act so as to oppose the compression of the spring as shown in Fig. 6.9. We invoke the work-energy theorem, rather than the conservation of mechanical energy. The change in kinetic energy is l equilibrium my position Fig. 6.9 The forces acting on the car.

1750,742,"SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 153 a circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius of the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of the point P from the axis. We also show the linear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is along the tangent at P to the circle. Let P’ be the position of the particle after an interval of time At (Fig. 7.16). The angle PCP’ describes the angular displacement A0 of the particle in time At. The average angular velocity of the particle over the interval At is AO/ At. As At tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller values), the ratio AO/ At approaches a limit which is the instantaneous angular velocity d6/dt of the particle at the position P. We denote the instantaneous angular velocity by a) (the Greek letter omega). We know from our study of circular motion that the magnitude of linear velocity v of a particle moving in a circle is related to the angular velocity of the particle 60 by the simple relation 1) = wr, where r is the radius of the circle. We observe that at any given instant the relation v = (0T applies to all particles of the rigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular distance ri from the fixed axis, the linear velocity at a given instant vi is given by vi = curl. (7.19) The index iruns from 1 to n, where n is the total number of particles of the body. For particles on the axis, r = 0 , and hence v = a) r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are stationary. This verifies that the axis is ﬁxed. Note that we use the same angular velocity u) for all the particles. We therefore, refer to (o as the angular velocity of the whole body. We have characterised pure translation of a body by all parts of the body having the same velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we may characterise pure rotation by all parts of the body having the same angular velocity at any instant of time. Note that this characterisation of the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis is just another way of saying as in Sec. 7. 1 that each particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has the centre on the axis. In our discussion so far the angular velocity appears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept it. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular velocity vector lies along the axis of rotation, and points out in the direction in which a right handed screw would advance, if the head of the screw is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 7 . 17a). The magnitude of this vector is a): dQ/dt referred as above. Fig. 7.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw rotates with the body, the screw advances in the direction of the angular velocity u). If the sense (clockwise or anticlockwise) of rotation of the body changes, so does the direction of a). Fig. 7.1 7 (b) The angular velocity vector on is directed along the ﬁxed axis as shown. The linear velocity of the particle at P is v = a) x r. It is perpendicular to both a) and r and is directed along the tangent to the circle described by the particle. We shall now look at what the vector product a) x r corresponds to. Refer to Fig. 7 . 17 (b) which is a part of Fig. 7.16 reproduced to show the path of the particle P. The figure shows the vector a) directed along the fixed (2—) axis and also the position vector r = op of the particle at P of the rigid body with respect to the origin 0. Note that the origin is chosen to be on the axis of rotation. 2019-20",0

Let s be the size of the source and S its distance from the plane of the two slits. For interference fringes to be seen, the condition s/S < M d should be satisfied; otherwise, interference patterns produced by different parts of the source overlap and no fringes are seen. Thus, as S decreases (i.e., the source slit is brought closer), the interference pattern gets less and less sharp, and when the source is brought too close for this condition to be valid, the fringes disappear. Till this happens, the fringe separation remains fixed. Same as in (d). As the source slit width increases, fringe pattern gets less and less sharp. When the source slit is so Wide that the condition 3/8 S X/d is not satisfied, the interference pattern disappears. The interference patterns due to different component colours of white light overlap (incoherently). The central bright fringes for different colours are at the same position. Therefore, the central fringe is ”white. For a point P for which SZP —SIP = 7‘12/ 2, where 7‘1: (z 4000 A) represents the wavelength for the blue colour, the blue component will be absent and the fringe will appear red in colour. Slightly farther away where 829—819 = 7‘1; = 7»/ 2 where Kr (22 8000 A) is the wavelength for the red colour, the fringe will be predominantly blue. Thus, the fringe closest on either side of the central white fringe is red and the farthest will appear blue. After a few fringes, no clear fringe pattern is seen. 10.6 DIFFRACTION If we look clearly at the shadow cast by an opaque object, close to the region of geometrical shadow, there are alternate dark and bright regions just like in interference. This happens due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Diffraction is a general characteristic exhibited by all types of waves, be it sound waves, light waves, water waves or matter waves.

The living world comprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man could easily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and living organisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea, fire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature of all such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of awe or fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms including human beings began much later in human history. Societies which indulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited progress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental description of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems of identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin off of such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities among living organisms both horizontally and vertically. That all present day living organisms are related to each other and also to all organisms that ever lived on this earth, was a revelation which humbled man and led to cultural movements for conservation of biodiversity. In the following chapters of this unit, you will get a description, including classification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective. 2019-2020",1

1757,1273,"BIOLOGY Obviously, since the formation of these structures does not involve two parents, the process involved is asexual. In some organisms, if the body breaks into distinct pieces (fragments) each fragment grows into an adult capable of producing offspring (e. g., Hydra). This is also a mode of asexual reproduction called fragmentation. You must have heard about the scourge of the water bodies or about the ‘terror of Bengal’. This is nothing but the aquatic plant ‘Water hyacinth’ which is one of the most invasive weeds found growing wherever there is standing water. It drains oxygen from the water, which leads to death of fishes. You will learn more about it in Chapters 13 and 14. You may ﬁnd it interesting to know that this plant was introduced in India because of its beautiful ﬂowers and shape of leaves. Since it can propagate vegetatively at a phenomenal rate and spread all over the water body in a short period of time, it is very difﬁcult to get rid off them. Are you aware how plants like potato, sugarcane, banana, ginger, dahlia are cultivated? Have you seen small plants emerging from the buds (called eyes) of the potato tuber, from the rhizomes of banana and ginger? When you carefully try to determine the site of origin of the new plantlets in the plants listed above, you will notice that they invariably arise from the nodes present in the modiﬁed stems of these plants. When the nodes come in contact with damp soil or water, they produce roots and new plants. Similarly, adventitious buds arise from the notches present at margins of leaves of Bryophyllum. This ability is fully exploited by gardeners and farmers for commercial propagation of such plants. It is interesting to note that asexual reproduction is the common method of reproduction in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation, like algae and fungi and that they shift to sexual method of reproduction just before the onset of adverse conditions. Find out how sexual reproduction enables these organisms to survive during unfavourable conditions? Why is sexual reproduction favoured under such conditions? Asexual (vegetative) as well as sexual modes of reproduction are exhibited by the higher plants. On the other hand, only sexual mode of reproduction is present in most of the animals. 1 .2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION Sexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes, either by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite sex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the new organism. It is an elaborate, complex and slow process as compared to asexual reproduction. Because of the fusion of male and female gametes, sexual reproduction results in offspring that are not identical to the parents or amongst themselves.

Kidney and Gastrointestinal Tract Mechanism of Honnone Action HOSOCHZZ CHAPTER 22 CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION You have already learnt that the neural system provides a point-to-point rapid coordination among organs. The neural coordination is fast but short-lived. As the nerve fibres do not innervate all cells of the body and the cellular functions need to be continuously regulated; a special kind of coordination and integration has to be provided. This function is carried out by hormones. The neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and regulate the physiological functions in the body. 22.1 ENDOCRINE GLANDs AND HORMONES Endocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific deﬁnition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts. The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here. 2019-2020",1
1760,437,"LAWS OF MOTION The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is conserved. An important example of the application of the law of conservation of momentum is the collision of two bodies. Consider two bodies A and B, with initial momenta p A and p3. The bodies collide, get apart, with final momenta p’A and p’B respectively. By the Second Law FABAt 2 PA — PA and FBAAt = P’B — PB (where we have taken a common interval of time for both forces i.e. the time for which the two bodies are in contact.) Since F AB = —FBA by the third law, p’A — pA = -(pia — p3) Le. P’A + P’B 2 PA + PB (5'9) which shows that the total final momentum of the isolated system equals its initial momentum. Notice that this is true whether the collision is elastic or inelastic. In elastic collisions, there is a second condition that the total initial kinetic energy of the system equals the total final kinetic energy (See Chapter 6). 5.8 EQUILIBRIUM OF A PARTICLE Equilibrium of a particle in mechanics refers to the situation when the net external force on the particle is zero’."" According to the first law, this means that, the particle is either at rest or in uniform motion. If two forces F1 and F2, act on a particle, equilibrium requires F1 = _F2 (5.10) i.e. the two forces on the particle must be equal and opposite. Equilibrium under three concurrent forces F1, F2 and F3 requires that the vector sum of the three forces is zero. F1+F2 +F3 = o (5.11) * Equilibrium of a body requires not only translational equilibrium (zero net external force) but also rotational 99 Fig. 5. 7 Equilibrium under concurrent forces. In other words, the resultant of any two forces say F1 and F2, obtained by the parallelogram law of forces must be equal and opposite to the third force, F3. As seen in Fig. 5.7, the three forces in equilibrium can be represented by the sides of a triangle with the vector arrows taken in the same sense. The result can be generalised to any number of forces. A particle is in equilibrium under the action of forces F1, F2, Fn if they can be represented by the sides of a closed n-sided polygon with arrows directed in the same sense. Equation (5.1 1) implies that F1x + F2x+ F3x = 0 Fly + FZy + Fsy = 0 F12 +FZZ+F3Z=O (5.12) where FIX, Fly and F12 are the components of F1 along x, y and 2 directions respectively. > Example 5.6 See Fig. 5.8.

1763,872,"SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING PLANTS Let us study formation of the embryo sac in a little more detail. (Figure 2.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the 2-nucleate embryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions result in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8-nucleate stages of the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are strictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately by cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down leading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte or embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac (Figure 2.8b, c). Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and organised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are situated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell. There is a characteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo sac. Three cells are grouped together at the micropylar end and constitute the egg apparatus. The egg apparatus, in turn, consists of two synergids and one egg cell. The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the micropylar tip called filiform apparatus, which play an important role in guiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. Three cells are at the chalazal end and are called the antipodals. The large central cell, as mentioned earlier, has two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical angiosperm embryo sac, at maturity, though 8-nucleate is 7-celled. 2.2.3 Pollination In the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes in ﬂowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac, respectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be brought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved? Pollination is the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer of pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is termed pollination. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array of adaptations to achieve pollination. They make use of external agents to achieve pollination. Can you list the possible external agents? Kinds of Pollination : Depending on the source of pollen, pollination can be divided into three types. (i) Autogamy : In this type, pollination is achieved within the same ﬂower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same ﬂower (Figure 2.9a). In a normal ﬂower which opens and exposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather rare. Autogamy in such ﬂowers requires synchrony in pollen release and stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should 2019-2020",1

The released neurotransmitters bind to their speciﬁc receptors, present on the post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing the entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic neuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or inhibitory. 21.4 CENTRAL NEURAL SYSTEM The brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and acts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary movements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs (e. g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst, circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine glands and human behaviour. It is also the site for processing of vision, hearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts. The human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, the brain is covered by cranial meninges consisting of an outer layer called dura mater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid and an inner layer (which is in contact with the brain tissue) called pia mater.

Also VB is less negative than VA . Thus, VB > VA or (VB— VA) is positive. A small negative charge will be attracted towards positive charge. The negative charge moves from higher potential energy to lower potential energy. Therefore the sign of potential energy difference of a small negative charge between Q and P is positive. Similarly, (P.E.)A > (P.E.)B and hence sign of potential energy differences is positive. In moving a small positive charge from Q to P, work has to be done by an external agency against the electric field. Therefore, work done by the field is negative. In moving a small negative charge from B to A work has to be done by the external agency. It is positive. Due to force of repulsion on the negative charge, velocity decreases and hence the kinetic energy decreases in going from B to A. 2019-20 z 'z El’IdWVXﬂ 93 1114qu .g z l5933;115—lenuaiodgnba -[)[GU-9AglBAJGSUOD-Aa-AgJaLla-D!J13|G-|L‘HUBIOd-D!191501138[3-17/LpJBM/np9'1!LLI’OE)[)!/\//ZdnL| k 9 H78 4_ :saoeims [enumodinba '[enumod 31110913 FSTES 59",0

1767,817,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS water. A seed may appear dry but it still has water — otherwise it would not be alive and respiring! Terrestrial plants take up huge amount water daily but most of it is lost to the air through evaporation from the leaves, i.e., transpiration. A mature corn plant absorbs almost three litres of water in a day, while a mustard plant absorbs water equal to its own weight in about 5 hours. Because of this high demand for water, it is not surprising that water is often the limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both agricultural and natural environments. 1 1 .2. 1 Water Potential To comprehend plant-water relations, an understanding of certain standard terms is necessary. Water potential (WW) is a concept fundamental to understanding water movement. Solute potential 01’s) and pressure potential (WP) are the two main components that determine water potential. Water molecules possess kinetic energy. In liquid and gaseous form they are in random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater the concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or ‘water potential’. Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest water potential. If two systems containing water are in contact, random movement of water molecules will result in net movement of water molecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy. Thus water will move from the system containing water at higher water potential to the one having low water potential This process of movement of substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion. Water potential is denoted by the Greek symbol Psi or ‘l‘ and is expressed in pressure units such as pascals (Pa). By convention, the water potential of pure water at standard temperatures, which is not under any pressure, is taken to be zero. If some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free water molecules and the concentration (free energy) of water decreases, reducing its water potential. Hence, all solutions have a lower water potential than pure water; the magnitude of this lowering due to dissolution of a solute is called solute potential or ‘PS. ‘1; is always negative. The more the solute molecules, the lower (more negative) is the ‘PS . For a solution at atmospheric pressure (water potential) ‘Pw = (solute potential) ‘PS. If a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure water or a solution, its water potential increases. It is equivalent to pumping water from one place to another. Can you think of any system in our body where pressure is built up? Pressure can build up in a plant system when water enters a plant cell due to diffusion causing a pressure built up against the cell wall, it makes the cell turgid (see section 1 1.2.2); 179",1
1768,832,"30 BIOLOGY not only the external features, but also internal features, like ultra- structure, anatomy, embryology and phytochemistry. Such a classiﬁcation for ﬂowering plants was given by George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker. At present phylogenetic classification systems based on evolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable. This assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common ancestor. We now use information from many other sources too to help resolve difﬁculties in classiﬁcation. These become more important when there is no supporting fossil evidence. Numerical Taxonomy which is now easily carried out using computers is based on all observable characteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters and the data are then processed. In this way each character is given equal importance and at the same time hundreds of characters can be considered. Cytotaxonomy that is based on cytological information like chromosome number, structure, behaviour and chemotaxonomy that uses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions, are also used by taxonomists these days. 3. l ALGAE Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e. g., on sloth bear). The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial forms like Volvox and the ﬁlamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra (Figure 3. 1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant bodies. The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of spores, the most common being the zoospores. They are ﬂagellated (motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be ﬂagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-ﬂagellated (non-motile) but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called isogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of Eudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, non- motile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed oogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.",1

Actin ﬁlaments are thinner as compared to the myosin ﬁlaments, hence are commonly called thin and thick ﬁlaments respectively. In the centre of each ‘1’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin filaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick ﬁlaments in the ‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin ﬁbrous membrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘1’ bands are arranged alternately throughout the length of the myoﬁbrils. The portion of the myoﬁbril between two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of contraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 20.2). In a resting state, the edges of thin ﬁlaments on either side of the thick ﬁlaments partially overlap the free ends of the thick ﬁlaments leaving the central part of the thick ﬁlaments.

1771,1122,"324 BIOLOGY itself continues forward to form a pigmented and opaque structure called the iris which is the visible coloured portion of the eye. The eye ball contains a transparent crystalline lens which is held in place by ligaments attached to the ciliary body. In front of the lens, the aperture surrounded by the iris is called the pupil. The diameter of the pupil is regulated by the muscle ﬁbres of iris. The inner layer is the retina and it contains three layers of neural cells — from inside to outside — ganglion cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. There are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely, rods and cones. These cells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and the twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain a purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which contains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types of cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that respond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours are produced by various combinations of these cones and their photopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of white light is produced. The optic nerves leave the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter it at a point medial to and slightly above the posterior pole of the eye ball. Photoreceptor cells are not present in that region and hence it is called the blind spot. At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot, there is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit called the fovea. The fovea is a thinned-out portion of the retina where only the cones are densely packed. It is the point where the visual acuity (resolution) is the greatest. The space between the cornea and the lens is called the aqueous chamber and contains a thin watery ﬂuid called aqueous humor. The space between the lens and the retina is called the vitreous chamber and is ﬁlled with a transparent gel called vitreous humor. 21 .6.1 .2 Mechanism of Vision The light rays in visible wavelength focussed on the retina through the cornea and lens generate potentials (impulses) in rods and cones. As mentioned earlier, the photosensitive compounds (photopigments) in the human eyes is composed of opsin (a protein) and retinal (an aldehyde of vitamin A). Light induces dissociation of the retinal from opsin resulting in changes in the structure of the opsin. This causes membrane permeability changes. As a result, potential differences are generated in the photoreceptor cells. This produces a signal that generates action potentials in the ganglion cells through the bipolar cells. These action potentials (impulses) are transmitted by the optic nerves to the visual",1

Can you now correlate which two properties of genetic code you have learnt? 6.6. 1 Mutations and Genetic Code The relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation studies. You have studied about mutation and its effect in Chapter 5. Effects of large deletions and rearrangements in a segment of DNA are easy to comprehend. It may result in loss or gain of a gene and so a function. The effect of point mutations will be explained here. A classical example of point mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin chain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine. It results into a diseased condition called as sickle cell anemia. Effect of point mutations that inserts or deletes a base in structural gene can be better understood by following simple example. Consider a statement that is made up of the following words each having three letters like genetic code. RAM HAS RED CAP If we insert a letter B in between HAS and RED and rearrange the statement, it would read as follows: RAMHASBREDCAP Similarly, if we now insert two letters at the same place, say BI'. Now it would read, RAM HAS BIR EDC AP Now we insert three letters together, say BIG, the statement would read RAM HAS BIG RED CAP The same exercise can be repeated, by deleting the letters R, E and D, one by one and rearranging the statement to make a triplet word. RAM HAS EDC AP RAM HAS DCA P RAMHAS CAP The conclusion from the above exercise is very obvious.

1773,942,"TRANSPORT IN PLANTS membrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast does not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is through mass ﬂow. As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or the atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the apoplast, hence mass ﬂow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive properties of water. The symplastic system is the system of interconnected protoplasts. Neighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that extend through plasmodesmata. During symplastic movement, the water travels through the cells — their cytoplasm; intercellular movement is through the plasmodesmata. Water has to enter the cells through the cell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again down a potential gradient. Symplastic movement may be aided by cytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming in cells of the Hydrilla leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming is easily visible. Most of the water ﬂow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the cortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water movement. However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the endodermis, is impervious to water because of a band of suberised matrix called the casparian strip. Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so they are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells proper through the membranes. The water then moves through the symplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem. The movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic in the endodermis. This is the only way water and other solutes can enter the vascular cylinder. Once inside the xylem, water is again free to move between cells as well as through them. In young roots, water enters directly into the xylem vessels and / or tracheids. These are non-living conduits and so are parts of the apoplast. The path of water and mineral ions into the root vascular system is summarised in Figure 1 1.7.

As before, let us take the direction from the observer to the source as the positive direction. Let the source and the observer be moving with velocities us and v0 respectively as shown in Fig. 15.18. Suppose at time t = O, the observer is at O1 and the source is at SI, 01 being to the left of SI. The source emits a wave of velocity v, of frequency v and period TO all measured by an observer at rest with respect to the medium. Let L be the distance between 01 and S1 at t= 0, when the source emits the first crest. Now, since the observer is moving, the velocity of the wave relative to the observer is v+ vo. Therefore, the first crest reaches the observer at time t1 = L/ (U + v0). At time t = To, both the observer and the source have moved to their new positions 02 and 82 respectively. The new distance between the observer and the source, 02 82, would be L+(vS—v0) To]. At 82, the source emits a second crest. 2019-20 Fig. 1 5. 1 8 Doppler effect when both the source and observer are moving with different velocities. Application of Doppler effect The change in frequency caused by a moving object due to Doppler effect is used to measure their velocities in diverse areas such as military. medical science. astrophysics. etc. It is also used by police to check over—speeding of vehicles. A sound wave or electromagnetic wave of known frequency is sent towards a moving object. Some part of the wave is reﬂected from the object and its frequency is detected by the monitoring station. This change in frequency is called Doppler shift. It is used at airports to guide aircraft. and in the military to detect enemy aircraft. Astrophysicists use it to measure the velocities of stars.

On the other hand, some of the sperms bear the X—chromosome whereas some do not. Eggs fertilised by sperm having an X—chromosome become females and, those fertilised by sperms that do not have an X—chromosome become males. Do you think the number of chromosomes in the male and female are equal? Due to the involvement of the X-chromosome in the determination of sex, it was designated to be the sex chromosome, and the rest of the chromosomes were named as autosomes.Grasshopper is an example of 9 X0 type of sex determination in which the males have only one X—chromosome besides the autosomes, whereas females have a pair r of X-chromosomes.

The interaction where one species is beneﬁtted and the other is neither beneﬁtted nor harmed is called commensalism. In amensalism on the other hand one species is harmed whereas the other is unaffected. Predation, parasitism and commensalism share a common characteristic— the interacting species live closely together. (i) Predation: What would happen to all the energy fixed by autotrophic organisms if the community has no animals to eat the plants? You can think of predation as nature’s way of transferring to higher trophic levels the energy ﬁxed by plants. When we think of predator and prey, most probably it is the tiger and the deer that readily come to our mind, but a sparrow eating any seed is no less a predator. Although animals eating plants are categorised separately as herbivores, they are, in a broad ecological context, not very different from predators. Besides acting as ‘conduits’ for energy transfer across trophic levels, predators play other important roles. They keep prey populations under control. But for predators, prey species could achieve very high population densities and cause ecosystem instability. When certain exotic species are introduced into a geographical area, they become invasive and start spreading fast because the invaded land does not have its natural predators. The prickly pear cactus introduced into Australia in the early 1920’s caused havoc by spreading rapidly into millions of hectares of rangeland. Finally, the invasive cactus was brought under control only after a cactus-feeding predator (a moth) from its natural habitat was introduced into the country. Biological control methods adopted in agricultural pest control are based on the ability of the predator to regulate prey population. Predators also help in maintaining species diversity in a community, by reducing the intensity of competition among competing prey species. In the rocky intertidal communities of the American Paciﬁc Coast the starﬁsh Pisaster is an important predator. In a ﬁeld experiment, when all the starﬁsh were removed from an enclosed intertidal area, more than 10 species of invertebrates became extinct within a year, because of inter- speciﬁc competition. If a predator is too efﬁcient and overexploits its prey, then the prey might become extinct and following it, the predator will also become extinct for lack of food. This is the reason why predators in nature are ‘prudent’. Prey species have evolved various defenses to lessen the impact of predation. Some species of insects and frogs are cryptically—coloured (camouﬂaged) to avoid being detected easily by the predator. Some are poisonous and therefore avoided by the 2019—2020 233",1

Assume that there is no loss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a X closed circuit enclosing an area that changes X as PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B which is perpendicular to the plane of X this system. If the length R9 = xand RS = l, the magnetic ﬂux (DB enclosed by the loop PQRS X will be X ch = le Since xis changing with time, the rate of change of ﬂux (DB will induce an emf given by: FIGURE 6.10 The ann PQ is moved to the left _ déb (1 side. thus decreasing the area of the E: B = —— (le) rectangular loop.

All the varieties, he conjectured, evolved on the island itself.

This process of evolution of different species in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally radiating to other areas of geography (habitats) is called adaptive radiation.

1780,1416,"GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE Put together, they mean description of the earth. The earth has always been seen as the abode of human beings and thus, scholars deﬁned geography as, “the description of the earth as the abode of human beings”. You are aware of the fact that reality is always multifaceted and the ‘earth’ is also multi-dimensional, that is why many disciplines from natural sciences such as geology, pedology, oceanography, botany, zoology and meteorology and a number of sister disciplines in social sciences such as economics, history, sociology, political science, anthropology, etc. study different aspects of the earth’s surface. Geography is different from other sciences in its subject matter and methodology but at the same time, it is closely related to other disciplines. Geography derives its data base from all the natural and social sciences and attempts their synthesis. We have noted that there exist variations over the surface of the earth in its physical as well as cultural environment. A number of phenomena are similar and many are dissimilar. It was, therefore, logical to perceive geography as the study of areal differentiation. Thus, geography was perceived to study all those phenomena which vary over space. Geographers do not study only the variations in the phenomena over the earth’s surface (space) but also study the associations with the other factors which cause these variations. For example, cropping patterns differ from region to region but this variation in cropping pattern, as a phenomenon, is related to variations in soils, climates, demands in the market, capacity of the farmer to invest and technological inputs available to her/ him. Thus, the concern of geography is to find out the causal relationship between any two phenomena or between more than one phenomenon. A geographer explains the phenomena in a frame of cause and effect relationship, as it does not only help in interpretation but also foresees the phenomena in future. The geographical phenomena, both the physical and human, are not static but highly dynamic. They change over time as a result of the interactive processes between ever 3 changing earth and untiring and ever-active human beings. Primitive human societies were directly dependent on their immediate environment. Geography, thus, is concerned with the study of Nature and Human interactions as an integrated whole. ‘Human’ is an integral part of ‘nature’ and ‘nature’ has the imprints of ‘human’. ‘Nature’ has inﬂuenced different aspects of human life. Its imprints can be noticed on food, clothing, shelter and occupation. Human beings have come to terms with nature through adaptation and modiﬁcation. As you already know, the present society has passed the stage of primitive societies, which were directly dependent on their immediate physical environment for sustenance. Present societies have modified their natural environment by inventing and using technology and thus, have expanded the horizon of their operation by appropriating and utilising the resources provided by nature. With the gradual development of technology, human beings were able to loosen the shackles of their physical environment. Technology helped in reducing the harshness of labour, increased labour efficiency and provided leisure to human beings to attend to the higher needs of life. It also increased the scale of production and the mobility of labour. The interaction between the physical environment and human beings has been very succinctly described by a poet in the following dialogue between ‘human’ and ‘nature’ (God). You created the soil, I created the cup, you created night, I created the lamp. You created wilderness, hilly terrains and deserts; I created ﬂower beds and gardens. Human beings have claimed their contribution using natural resources. With the help of technology, human beings moved from the stage of necessity to a stage of freedom. They have put their imprints everywhere and created new possibilities in collaboration with nature. Thus, we now find humanised nature and naturalised human beings and geography studies this interactive relationship. The space got organised with the help of the means of transportation and communication network.

In fact, accounting data “reﬂect a combination of recorded facts, accounting conventions and personal judgements which affect them materially. For example, proﬁt of the business is not a precise and final ﬁgure. It is merely an opinion of the accountant based on application of accounting policies. The soundness of the j udgement necessarily depends on the competence and integrity of those who make them and on their adherence to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Conventions"". Thus, the ﬁnancial statements may not reveal the true state of affairs of the enterprises and so the ratios will also not give the true picture. 2. Ignores Price-level Changes: The ﬁnancial accounting is based on stable money measurement principle. It implicitly assumes that price level changes are either non-existent or minimal. But the truth is otherwise. We are normally living in inﬂationary economies where the power of money declines constantly. A change in the price—level makes analysis of ﬁnancial statement of different accounting years meaningless because accounting records ignore changes in value of money. 3. Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects: Accounting provides information about quantitative (or monetary) aspects of business. Hence, the ratios also reﬂect only the monetary aspects, ignoring completely the non-monetary (qualitative) factors. 4. Variations in Accounting Practices: There are differing accounting policies for valuation of inventory, calculation of depreciation, treatment of intangibles Assets definition of certain financial variables etc., available for various aspects of business transactions.

We first consider the simple case when the rectangular loop is placed such that the uniform magnetic field B is in the plane of the loop. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.2 1(a). The field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC Of the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB Of the loop and exerts a force F1 on it which is directed into the plane Of the loop. Its magnitude is, F1 = I b B Similarly, it exerts a force F2 on the arm CD and F2 is directed out Of the plane Of the paper. F2 = I b B = F1 F, Thus, the net force on the loop is zero.

1784,25,"l Physics Unregulated voltage (V1) Zener diode as a voltage regulator We know that when the ac input voltage of a rectiﬁer ﬂuctuates, its rectiﬁed output also ﬂuctuates. To get a constant dc voltage from the dc unregulated output of a rectiﬁer, we use a Zener diode. The circuit diagram of a voltage regulator using a Zener diode is shown in Fig. 14.22. The unregulated dc voltage (ﬁltered output of a rectiﬁer) is connected to the Zener diode through a series resistance Rs such that the Zener diode is reverse biased. If the input voltage increases, the current through RS and Zener diode also increases. This increases the voltage drop across Rs without any change in the voltage across the Zener diode. This is because in the Regulated breakdown region, Zener voltage remains constant even Load voltage though the current through the Zener diode changes. RL (Vz) Similarly, if the input voltage decreases, the current through Rs and Zener diode also decreases. The voltage drop across Rs decreases without any change in the FIGURE 14.22 Zener diode as DC voltage across the Zener diode. Thus any increase/ V01t€1g€ regUlatOF decrease in the input voltage results in, increase/ 486 EXAMPLE 14.5 decrease of the voltage drop across Rs without any change in voltage across the Zener diode. Thus the Zener diode acts as a voltage regulator. We have to select the Zener diode according to the required output voltage and accordingly the series resistance Rs. Example 14.5 In a Zener regulated power supply a Zener diode with VZ = 6.0 V is used for regulation. The load current is to be 4.0 mA and the unregulated input is 10.0 V. What should be the value of series resistor RS? Solution The value of RS should be such that the current through the Zener diode is much larger than the load current. This is to have good load regulation. Choose Zener current as five times the load current, i.e., IZ = 20 mA. The total current through RS is, therefore, 24 mA. The voltage drop across Rs is 10.0 — 6.0 = 4.0 V. This gives RS = 4.0V/ (24 X 10's) A = 167 S2. The nearest value of carbon resistor is 150 Q. So, a series resistor of 150 S2 is appropriate. Note that slight variation in the value of the resistor does not matter, what is important is that the current IZ should be sufficiently larger than IL. 14.8.2 Optoelectronic junction devices We have seen so far, how a semiconductor diode behaves under applied electrical inputs.
